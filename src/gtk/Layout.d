/**
 * Description
 * GtkLayout is similar to GtkDrawingArea in that it's a "blank slate"
 * and doesn't do anything but paint a blank background by default. It's
 * different in that it supports scrolling natively (you can add it to a
 * GtkScrolledWindow), and it can contain child widgets, since it's a
 * GtkContainer. However if you're just going to draw, a GtkDrawingArea
 * is a better choice since it has lower overhead.
 * When handling expose events on a GtkLayout, you must draw to
 * GTK_LAYOUT (layout)->bin_window, rather than to
 * GTK_WIDGET (layout)->window, as you would for a drawing
 * area.
