	 * If you haven't changed the window gravity, its gravity will be

	 * Thus GTK+ is using a "best guess" that works with most

	 * Moreover, nearly all window managers are historically broken with
	 * respect to their handling of window gravity. So moving a window to
	 * its current position as returned by gtk_window_get_position() tends
	 * to result in moving the window slightly. Window managers are

	 * If a window has gravity GDK_GRAVITY_STATIC the window manager
	 * frame is not relevant, and thus gtk_window_get_position() will
	 * always produce accurate results. However you can't use static
	 * gravity to do things like place a window in a corner of the screen,
	 * because static gravity ignores the window manager decorations.
	 * If you are saving and restoring your application's window
	 * positions, you should know that it's impossible for applications to
	 * do this without getting it somewhat wrong because applications do
	 * not have sufficient knowledge of window manager state. The Correct

	 * gtk_window_get_size() is the last size received in a
	 * GdkEventConfigure, that is, GTK+ uses its locally-stored size,
	 * rather than querying the X server for the size. As a result, if you

	 * gtk_window_get_size(), the size won't have taken effect yet. After
	 * the window manager processes the resize request, GTK+ receives
	 * notification that the size has changed via a configure event, and
	 * the size of the window gets updated.
	 * Note 1: Nearly any use of this function creates a race condition,

	 * Note 3: If you are getting a window size in order to position
	 * the window onscreen, there may be a better way. The preferred
	 * way is to simply set the window's semantic type with
