/**
 * A GtkWindow is a toplevel window which can contain other widgets.
 * Windows normally have decorations that are under the control
 * of the windowing system and allow the user to manipulate the window
 * (resize it, move it, close it,...).
 * 
 * # GtkWindow as GtkBuildable
 * 
 * The GtkWindow implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports a
 * custom <accel-groups> element, which supports any number of <group>
 * elements representing the #GtkAccelGroup objects you want to add to
 * your window (synonymous with gtk_window_add_accel_group().
 * 
 * It also supports the <initial-focus> element, whose name property names
 * the widget to receive the focus when the window is mapped.
 * 
 * An example of a UI definition fragment with accel groups:
 * |[
 * <object class="GtkWindow">
 * <accel-groups>
 * <group name="accelgroup1"/>
 * </accel-groups>
 * <initial-focus name="thunderclap"/>
 * </object>
 * 
 * ...
 * 
 * <object class="GtkAccelGroup" id="accelgroup1"/>
 * ]|
 * 
 * The GtkWindow implementation of the GtkBuildable interface supports
 * setting a child as the titlebar by specifying “titlebar” as the “type”
 * attribute of a <child> element.
 * 
 * # CSS nodes
 * 
 * |[<!-- language="plain" -->
 * window
 * ├── decoration
 * ╰── <child>
 * ]|
 * 
 * GtkWindow has a main CSS node with name window and style class .background,
 * and a subnode with name decoration.
 * 
 * Style classes that are typically used with the main CSS node are .csd (when
 * client-side decorations are in use), .solid-csd (for client-side decorations
 * without invisible borders), .ssd (used by mutter when rendering server-side
 * decorations). GtkWindow also represents window states with the following
 * style classes on the main node: .tiled, .maximized, .fullscreen. Specialized
 * types of window often add their own discriminating style classes, such as
 * .popup or .tooltip.
 * 
 * GtkWindow adds the .titlebar and .default-decoration style classes to the
 * widget that is added as a titlebar child.

	 * The reliability of this function depends on the windowing system

	 * If you haven’t changed the window gravity, its gravity will be
	 * #GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST. This means that gtk_window_get_position()

	 * gravity to do things like place a window in a corner of the screen,
	 * because static gravity ignores the window manager decorations.
	 *
	 * Ideally, this function should return appropriate values if the

	 * In practice, saving the window position should not be left to
