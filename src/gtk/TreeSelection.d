/**
 * Description
 * The GtkTreeSelection object is a helper object to manage the selection
 * for a GtkTreeView widget. The GtkTreeSelection object is
 * automatically created when a new GtkTreeView widget is created, and
 * cannot exist independentally of this widget. The primary reason the
 * GtkTreeSelection objects exists is for cleanliness of code and API.
 * That is, there is no conceptual reason all these functions could not be
 * methods on the GtkTreeView widget instead of a separate function.
 * The GtkTreeSelection object is gotten from a GtkTreeView by calling
 * gtk_tree_view_get_selection(). It can be manipulated to check the
 * selection status of the tree, as well as select and deselect individual
 * rows. Selection is done completely view side. As a result, multiple
 * views of the same model can have completely different selections.
 * Additionally, you cannot change the selection of a row on the model that
 * is not currently displayed by the view without expanding its parents
 * first.
 * One of the important things to remember when monitoring the selection of
 * a view is that the "changed" signal is mostly a hint. That is, it may
 * only emit one signal when a range of rows is selected. Additionally, it
 * may on occasion emit a ::changed signal when nothing has happened
 * (mostly as a result of programmers calling select_row on an already
 * selected row).
