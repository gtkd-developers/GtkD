/**
 * Description
 * GtkRecentManager provides a facility for adding, removing and
 * looking up recently used files. Each recently used file is
 * identified by its URI, and has meta-data associated to it, like
 * the names and command lines of the applications that have
 * registered it, the number of time each application has registered
 * the same file, the mime type of the file and whether the file
 * should be displayed only by the applications that have
 * registered it.
 * The GtkRecentManager acts like a database of all the recently
 * used files. You can create new GtkRecentManager objects, but
 * it is more efficient to use the standard recent manager for
 * the GdkScreen so that informations about the recently used
 * files is shared with other people using them. In case the
 * default screen is being used, adding a new recently used
 * file is as simple as:
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 * While looking up a recently used file is as simple as:
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 * Recently used files are supported since GTK+ 2.10.
