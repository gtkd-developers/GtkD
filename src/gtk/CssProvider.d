/**
 * GtkCssProvider is an object implementing the GtkStyleProvider interface.
 * It is able to parse CSS-like
 * input in order to style widgets.
 *
 * Default files
 *
 * An application can cause GTK+ to parse a specific CSS style sheet by
 * calling gtk_css_provider_load_from_file() and adding the provider with
 * gtk_style_context_add_provider() or gtk_style_context_add_provider_for_screen().
 * In addition, certain files will be read when GTK+ is initialized. First,
 * the file $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gtk-3.0/gtk.css
 * is loaded if it exists. Then, GTK+ tries to load
 * $HOME/.themes/theme-name/gtk-3.0/gtk.css,
 * falling back to
 * datadir/share/themes/theme-name/gtk-3.0/gtk.css,
 * where theme-name is the name of the current theme
 * (see the "gtk-theme-name" setting) and datadir
 * is the prefix configured when GTK+ was compiled, unless overridden by the
 * GTK_DATA_PREFIX environment variable.
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * Style sheets
 *
 * The basic structure of the style sheets understood by this provider is
 * a series of statements, which are either rule sets or '@-rules', separated
 * by whitespace.
 *
 * A rule set consists of a selector and a declaration block, which is
 * a series of declarations enclosed in curly braces ({ and }). The
 * declarations are separated by semicolons (;). Multiple selectors can
 * share the same declaration block, by putting all the separators in
 * front of the block, separated by commas.
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * Selectors
 *
 * Selectors work very similar to the way they do in CSS, with widget class
 * names taking the role of element names, and widget names taking the role
 * of IDs. When used in a selector, widget names must be prefixed with a
 * '#' character. The '*' character represents the so-called universal
 * selector, which matches any widget.
 *
 * To express more complicated situations, selectors can be combined in
 * various ways:
 *
 * To require that a widget satisfies several conditions,
 *  combine several selectors into one by concatenating them. E.g.
 *  GtkButton#button1 matches a GtkButton widget
 *  with the name button1.
 *
 * To only match a widget when it occurs inside some other
 *  widget, write the two selectors after each other, separated by whitespace.
 *  E.g. GtkToolBar GtkButton matches GtkButton widgets
 *  that occur inside a GtkToolBar.
 *
 * In the previous example, the GtkButton is matched even
 *  if it occurs deeply nested inside the toolbar. To restrict the match
 *  to direct children of the parent widget, insert a '>' character between
 *  the two selectors. E.g. GtkNotebook > GtkLabel matches
 *  GtkLabel widgets that are direct children of a GtkNotebook.
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * Widgets may also define style classes, which can be used for matching.
 * When used in a selector, style classes must be prefixed with a '.'
 * character.
 *
 * Refer to the documentation of individual widgets to learn which
 * style classes they define and see the section called “Style classes and regions”
 * for a list of all style classes used by GTK+ widgets.
 *
 * Note that there is some ambiguity in the selector syntax when it comes
 * to differentiation widget class names from regions. GTK+ currently treats
 * a string as a widget class name if it contains any uppercase characters
 * (which should work for more widgets with names like GtkLabel).
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * In complicated widgets like e.g. a GtkNotebook, it may be desirable
 * to style different parts of the widget differently. To make this
 * possible, container widgets may define regions, whose names
 * may be used for matching in selectors.
 *
 * Some containers allow to further differentiate between regions by
 * applying so-called pseudo-classes to the region. For example, the
 * tab region in GtkNotebook allows to single out the first or last
 * tab by using the :first-child or :last-child pseudo-class.
 * When used in selectors, pseudo-classes must be prefixed with a
 * ':' character.
 *
 * Refer to the documentation of individual widgets to learn which
 * regions and pseudo-classes they define and see
 * the section called “Style classes and regions” for a list of all regions
 * used by GTK+ widgets.
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * Another use of pseudo-classes is to match widgets depending on their
 * state. This is conceptually similar to the :hover, :active or :focus
 * pseudo-classes in CSS. The available pseudo-classes for widget states
 * are :active, :prelight (or :hover), :insensitive, :selected, :focused
 * and :inconsistent.
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * Widget state pseudoclasses may only apply to the last element
 * in a selector.
 *
 * To determine the effective style for a widget, all the matching rule
 * sets are merged. As in CSS, rules apply by specificity, so the rules
 * whose selectors more closely match a widget path will take precedence
 * over the others.
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * @ Rules
 *
 * GTK+'s CSS supports the @import rule, in order to load another
 * CSS style sheet in addition to the currently parsed one.
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * In order to extend key bindings affecting different widgets, GTK+
 * supports the @binding-set rule to parse a set of bind/unbind
 * directives, see GtkBindingSet for the supported syntax. Note that
 * the binding sets defined in this way must be associated with rule sets
 * by setting the gtk-key-bindings style property.
 *
 * Customized key bindings are typically defined in a separate
 * gtk-keys.css CSS file and GTK+ loads this file
 * according to the current key theme, which is defined by the
 * "gtk-key-theme-name" setting.
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * GTK+ also supports an additional @define-color rule, in order
 * to define a color name which may be used instead of color numeric
 * representations. Also see the "gtk-color-scheme" setting
 * for a way to override the values of these named colors.
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * Symbolic colors
 *
 * Besides being able to define color names, the CSS parser is also able
 * to read different color expressions, which can also be nested, providing
 * a rich language to define colors which are derived from a set of base
 * colors.
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 *  The various ways to express colors in GTK+ CSS are:
 *
 * Syntax
 * Explanation
 * Examples
 *
 * rgb(r, g, b)
 * An opaque color; r, g, b can be either integers between
 *  0 and 255 or percentages
 *
 * rgb(128, 10, 54)
 * rgb(20%, 30%, 0%)
 *
 * rgba(r, g, b, a)
 * A translucent color; r, g, b are as in the previous row,
 *  a is a floating point number between 0 and 1
 *
 * rgba(255, 255, 0, 0.5)
 *
 * #xxyyzz
 *
 * An opaque color; xx, yy, zz are hexadecimal numbers
 *  specifying r, g, b variants with between 1 and 4
 *  hexadecimal digits per component are allowed
 *
 * #ff12ab
 * #f0c
 *
 * @name
 * Reference to a color that has been defined with
 *  @define-color
 *
 * @bg_color
 *
 * mix(color1, color2, f)
 * A linear combination of color1 and color2. f is a
 *  floating point number between 0 and 1.
 *
 * mix(#ff1e0a, @bg_color, 0.8)
 *
 * shade(color, f)
 * A lighter or darker variant of color. f is a
 *  floating point number.
 *
 * shade(@fg_color, 0.5)
 *
 * lighter(color)
 * A lighter variant of color
 *
 * darker(color)
 * A darker variant of color
 *
 * alpha(color, f)
 * Modifies passed color's alpha by a factor f. f is a
 *  floating point number. f < 1.0 results in a more transparent
 *  color while f > 1.0 results in a more opaque color.
 *
 * alhpa(blue, 0.5)
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * Gradients
 *
 * Linear or radial Gradients can be used as background images.
 *
 * A linear gradient along the line from (start_x, start_y) to
 * (end_x, end_y) is specified using the syntax
 *
 * -gtk-gradient (linear,
 *  start_x start_y, end_x end_y,
 *  color-stop (position, color),
 *  ...)
 *
 * where start_x and end_x can be either a floating point number between
 * 0 and 1 or one of the special values 'left', 'right' or 'center', start_y
 * and end_y can be either a floating point number between 0 and 1 or one
 * of the special values 'top', 'bottom' or 'center', position is a floating
 * point number between 0 and 1 and color is a color expression (see above).
 * The color-stop can be repeated multiple times to add more than one color
 * stop. 'from (color)' and 'to (color)' can be used as abbreviations for
 * color stops with position 0 and 1, respectively.
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * A radial gradient along the two circles defined by (start_x, start_y,
 * start_radius) and (end_x, end_y, end_radius) is specified using the
 * syntax
 *
 * -gtk-gradient (radial,
 *  start_x start_y, start_radius,
 *  end_x end_y, end_radius,
 *  color-stop (position, color),
 *  ...)
 *
 * where start_radius and end_radius are floating point numbers and
 * the other parameters are as before.
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * Text shadow
 *
 * A shadow list can be applied to text or symbolic icons, using the CSS3
 * text-shadow syntax, as defined in
 * the CSS3 specification.
 *
 * A text shadow is specified using the syntax
 *
 * text-shadow: horizontal_offset vertical_offset [ blur_radius ] color
 *
 * The offset of the shadow is specified with the horizontal_offset and vertical_offset
 * parameters. The optional blur radius is parsed, but it is currently not rendered by
 * the GTK+ theming engine.
 *
 * To set multiple shadows on an element, you can specify a comma-separated list
 * of shadow elements in the text-shadow property. Shadows are always rendered
 * front-back, i.e. the first shadow specified is on top of the others. Shadows
 * can thus overlay each other, but they can never overlay the text itself,
 * which is always rendered on top of the shadow layer.
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * Box shadow
 *
 * Themes can apply shadows on framed elements using the CSS3 box-shadow syntax,
 * as defined in
 * the CSS3 specification.
 *
 * A box shadow is specified using the syntax
 *
 * box-shadow: [ inset ] horizontal_offset vertical_offset [ blur_radius ] [ spread ] color
 *
 * A positive offset will draw a shadow that is offset to the right (down) of the box,
 * a negative offset to the left (top). The optional spread parameter defines an additional
 * distance to expand the shadow shape in all directions, by the specified radius.
 * The optional blur radius parameter is parsed, but it is currently not rendered by
 * the GTK+ theming engine.
 * The inset parameter defines whether the drop shadow should be rendered inside or outside
 * the box canvas. Only inset box-shadows are currently supported by the GTK+ theming engine,
 * non-inset elements are currently ignored.
 *
 * To set multiple box-shadows on an element, you can specify a comma-separated list
 * of shadow elements in the box-shadow property. Shadows are always rendered
 * front-back, i.e. the first shadow specified is on top of the others, so they may
 * overlap other boxes or other shadows.
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * Border images
 *
 * Images and gradients can also be used in slices for the purpose of creating
 * scalable borders.
 * For more information, see the CSS3 documentation for the border-image property,
 * which can be found here.
 *
 * The parameters of the slicing process are controlled by
 * four separate properties. Note that you can use the
 *
 * border-image
 *
 *  shorthand property
 * to set values for the three properties at the same time.
 *
 * border-image-source: url(path)
 * (or border-image-source: -gtk-gradient(...))
 *
 * :
 * Specifies the source of the border image, and it can either
 * be an URL or a gradient (see above).
 *
 * border-image-slice: top right bottom left
 *
 * The sizes specified by the top, right, bottom and left parameters
 * are the offsets, in pixels, from the relevant edge where the image
 * should be "cut off" to build the slices used for the rendering
 * of the border.
 *
 * border-image-width: top right bottom left
 *
 * The sizes specified by the top, right, bottom and left parameters
 * are inward distances from the border box edge, used to specify the
 * rendered size of each slice determined by border-image-slice.
 * If this property is not specified, the values of border-width will
 * be used as a fallback.
 *
 * border-image-repeat: [stretch|repeat|round|space] ?
 * [stretch|repeat|round|space]
 *
 * Specifies how the image slices should be rendered in the area
 * outlined by border-width.
 * The default (stretch) is to resize the slice to fill in the whole
 * allocated area.
 * If the value of this property is 'repeat', the image slice
 * will be tiled to fill the area.
 * If the value of this property is 'round', the image slice will
 * be tiled to fill the area, and scaled to fit it exactly
 * a whole number of times.
 * If the value of this property is 'space', the image slice will
 * be tiled to fill the area, and if it doesn't fit it exactly a whole
 * number of times, the extra space is distributed as padding around
 * the slices.
 * If two options are specified, the first one affects
 * the horizontal behaviour and the second one the vertical behaviour.
 * If only one option is specified, it affects both.
 *

 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *
 * <hr>
 *
 * Styles can specify transitions that will be used to create a gradual
 * change in the appearance when a widget state changes. The following
 * syntax is used to specify transitions:
 *
 * duration [s|ms] [linear|ease|ease-in|ease-out|ease-in-out] [loop]?
 *
 * The duration is the amount of time that the animation will take for
 * a complete cycle from start to end. If the loop option is given, the
 * animation will be repated until the state changes again.
 * The option after the duration determines the transition function from a
 * small set of predefined functions.

 *
 * Figure 4. Ease transition
 *
 * Figure 5. Ease-in-out transition
 *
 * Figure 6. Ease-in transition

 *
 * Supported properties
 *
 * Properties are the part that differ the most to common CSS,
 * not all properties are supported (some are planned to be
 * supported eventually, some others are meaningless or don't
 * map intuitively in a widget based environment).
 *
 * The currently supported properties are:
 *
 * Property name
 * Syntax
 * Maps to
 * Examples
