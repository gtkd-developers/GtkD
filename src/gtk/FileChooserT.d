/**
 * Description
 * GtkFileChooser is an interface that can be implemented by file
 * selection widgets. In GTK+, the main objects that implement this
 * interface are GtkFileChooserWidget, GtkFileChooserDialog, and
 * GtkFileChooserButton. You do not need to write an object that
 * implements the GtkFileChooser interface unless you are trying to
 * adapt an existing file selector to expose a standard programming
 * interface.
 * GtkFileChooser allows for shortcuts to various places in the filesystem.
 * In the default implementation these are displayed in the left pane. It
 * may be a bit confusing at first taht these shortcuts come from various
 * sources and in various flavours, so lets explain the terminology here:
 * Bookmarks
 *  are created by the user, by dragging folders from the
 *  right pane to the left pane, or by using the "Add". Bookmarks
 *  can be renamed and deleted by the user.
 * Shortcuts
 *  can be provided by the application or by the underlying filesystem
 *  abstraction (e.g. both the gnome-vfs and the Windows filesystems
 *  provide "Desktop" shortcuts). Shortcuts cannot be modified by the
 *  user.
 * Volumes
 *  are provided by the underlying filesystem abstraction. They are
 *  the "roots" of the filesystem.
 * File Names and Encodings
 * When the user is finished selecting files in a
 * GtkFileChooser, your program can get the selected names
 * either as filenames or as URIs. For URIs, the normal escaping
 * rules are applied if the URI contains non-ASCII characters.
 * However, filenames are always returned in
 * the character set specified by the
 * G_FILENAME_ENCODING environment variable.
 * Please see the Glib documentation for more details about this
 * variable.
 * Note
 *  This means that while you can pass the result of
 *  gtk_file_chooser_get_filename() to
 *  open(2) or
 *  fopen(3), you may not be able to
 *  directly set it as the text of a GtkLabel widget unless you
 *  convert it first to UTF-8, which all GTK+ widgets expect.
 *  You should use g_filename_to_utf8() to convert filenames
 *  into strings that can be passed to GTK+ widgets.
 * <hr>
 * Adding a Preview Widget
 * You can add a custom preview widget to a file chooser and then
 * get notification about when the preview needs to be updated.
 * To install a preview widget, use
 * gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget(). Then, connect to the
 * "update-preview" signal to get notified when
 * you need to update the contents of the preview.
 * Your callback should use
 * gtk_file_chooser_get_preview_filename() to see what needs
 * previewing. Once you have generated the preview for the
 * corresponding file, you must call
 * gtk_file_chooser_set_preview_widget_active() with a boolean
 * flag that indicates whether your callback could successfully
 * generate a preview.
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 * <hr>
 * Adding Extra Widgets
 * You can add extra widgets to a file chooser to provide options
 * that are not present in the default design. For example, you
 * can add a toggle button to give the user the option to open a
 * file in read-only mode. You can use
 * gtk_file_chooser_set_extra_widget() to insert additional
 * widgets in a file chooser.
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 * Note
 *  If you want to set more than one extra widget in the file
 *  chooser, you can a container such as a GtkVBox or a GtkTable
 *  and include your widgets in it. Then, set the container as
 *  the whole extra widget.
 * <hr>
 * Key Bindings
 * Internally, GTK+ implements a file chooser's graphical user
 * interface with the private
 * GtkFileChooserDefaultClass. This
 * widget has several key
 * bindings and their associated signals. This section
 * describes the available key binding signals.
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 * You can change these defaults to something else. For
 * example, to add a Shift modifier to a few
 * of the default bindings, you can include the following
 * fragment in your .gtkrc-2.0 file:
 * binding "my-own-gtkfilechooser-bindings" {
	 * 	bind "<Alt><Shift>Up" {
		 * 		"up-folder" ()
	 * 	}
	 * 	bind "<Alt><Shift>Down" {
		 * 		"down-folder" ()
	 * 	}
	 * 	bind "<Alt><Shift>Home" {
		 * 		"home-folder" ()
	 * 	}
 * }
 * class "GtkFileChooserDefault" binding "my-own-gtkfilechooser-bindings"
 * The "GtkFileChooserDefault::location-popup" signal
 *  void user_function (GtkFileChooserDefault *chooser,
 *  const char *path,
 * gpointer user_data);
 * This is used to make the file chooser show a "Location"
 * dialog which the user can use to manually type the name of
 * the file he wishes to select. The
 * path argument is a string that gets
 * put in the text entry for the file name. By default this is bound to
 * Control+L
 * with a path string of "" (the empty
 * string). It is also bound to / with a
 * path string of "/"
 * (a slash): this lets you type / and
 * immediately type a path name. On Unix systems, this is bound to
 * ~ (tilde) with a path string
 * of "~" itself for access to home directories.
 * chooser :
 * 		the object which received the signal.
 * path :
 * 		default contents for the text entry for the file name
 * user_data :
 * 		user data set when the signal handler was connected.
 * Note
 *  You can create your own bindings for the
 *  GtkFileChooserDefault::location-popup signal with custom
 *  path strings, and have a crude form
 *  of easily-to-type bookmarks. For example, say you access
 *  the path /home/username/misc very
 *  frequently. You could then create an Alt+M
 *  shortcut by including the following in your
 *  .gtkrc-2.0:
 *   binding "misc-shortcut" {
	 *  bind "<Alt>M" {
		 *  "location-popup" ("/home/username/misc")
	 * 	 }
 *  }
 *  class "GtkFileChooserDefault" binding "misc-shortcut"
 * The "GtkFileChooserDefault::up-folder" signal
 *  void user_function (GtkFileChooserDefault *chooser,
 *  gpointer user_data);
 * This is used to make the file chooser go to the parent of
 * the current folder in the file hierarchy. By default this
 * is bound to Backspace and
 * Alt+Up
 * (the Up key in the numeric keypad also works).
 * chooser :
 * 		the object which received the signal.
 * user_data :
 * 		user data set when the signal handler was connected.
 * The "GtkFileChooserDefault::down-folder" signal
 *  void user_function (GtkFileChooserDefault *chooser,
 *  gpointer user_data);
 * This is used to make the file chooser go to a child of the
 * current folder in the file hierarchy. The subfolder that
 * will be used is displayed in the path bar widget of the file
 * chooser. For example, if the path bar is showing
 * "/foo/bar/baz", then this will cause
 * the file chooser to switch to the "baz" subfolder. By
 * default this is bound to
 * Alt+Down
 * (the Down key in the numeric keypad also works).
 * chooser :
 * 		the object which received the signal.
 * user_data :
 * 		user data set when the signal handler was connected.
 * The "GtkFileChooserDefault::home-folder" signal
 *  void user_function (GtkFileChooserDefault *chooser,
 *  gpointer user_data);
 * This is used to make the file chooser show the user's home
 * folder in the file list. By default this is bound to
 * Alt+Home
 * (the Home key in the numeric keypad also works).
 * chooser :
 * 		the object which received the signal.
 * user_data :
 * 		user data set when the signal handler was connected.
 * The "GtkFileChooserDefault::desktop-folder" signal
 *  void user_function (GtkFileChooserDefault *chooser,
 *  gpointer user_data);
 * This is used to make the file chooser show the user's Desktop
 * folder in the file list. By default this is bound to
 * Alt+D.
 * chooser :
 * 		the object which received the signal.
 * user_data :
 * 		user data set when the signal handler was connected.
 * The "GtkFileChooserDefault::quick-bookmark" signal
 *  void user_function (GtkFileChooserDefault *chooser,
 *  gint bookmark_index,
 *  gpointer user_data);
 * This is used to make the file chooser switch to the bookmark
 * specified in the bookmark_index parameter.
 * For example, if you have three bookmarks, you can pass 0, 1, 2 to
 * this signal to switch to each of them, respectively. By default this is bound to
 * Alt+1,
 * Alt+2,
 * etc. until
 * Alt+0. Note
 * that in the default binding,
 * that Alt+1 is
 * actually defined to switch to the bookmark at index 0, and so on
 * successively;
 * Alt+0 is
 * defined to switch to the bookmark at index 10.
 * chooser :
 * 		the object which received the signal.
 * bookmark_indes :
 * 		index of the bookmark to switch to; the indices start at 0.
 * user_data :
 * 		user data set when the signal handler was connected.
