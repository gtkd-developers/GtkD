/**
 * #GtkIconTheme provides a facility for looking up icons by name
 * and size. The main reason for using a name rather than simply
 * providing a filename is to allow different icons to be used
 * depending on what “icon theme” is selected
 * by the user. The operation of icon themes on Linux and Unix
 * follows the [Icon Theme Specification](http://www.freedesktop.org/Standards/icon-theme-spec)
 * There is a fallback icon theme, named `hicolor`, where applications
 * should install their icons, but additional icon themes can be installed
 * as operating system vendors and users choose.
 * 
 * Named icons are similar to the deprecated [Stock Items][gtkstock],
 * and the distinction between the two may be a bit confusing.
 * A few things to keep in mind:
 * 
 * - Stock images usually are used in conjunction with
 * [Stock Items][gtkstock], such as %GTK_STOCK_OK or
 * %GTK_STOCK_OPEN. Named icons are easier to set up and therefore
 * are more useful for new icons that an application wants to
 * add, such as application icons or window icons.
 * 
 * - Stock images can only be loaded at the symbolic sizes defined
 * by the #GtkIconSize enumeration, or by custom sizes defined
 * by gtk_icon_size_register(), while named icons are more flexible
 * and any pixel size can be specified.
 * 
 * - Because stock images are closely tied to stock items, and thus
 * to actions in the user interface, stock images may come in
 * multiple variants for different widget states or writing
 * directions.
 * 
 * A good rule of thumb is that if there is a stock image for what
 * you want to use, use it, otherwise use a named icon. It turns
 * out that internally stock images are generally defined in
 * terms of one or more named icons. (An example of the
 * more than one case is icons that depend on writing direction;
 * %GTK_STOCK_GO_FORWARD uses the two themed icons
 * “gtk-stock-go-forward-ltr” and “gtk-stock-go-forward-rtl”.)
 * 
 * In many cases, named themes are used indirectly, via #GtkImage
 * or stock items, rather than directly, but looking up icons
 * directly is also simple. The #GtkIconTheme object acts
 * as a database of all the icons in the current theme. You
 * can create new #GtkIconTheme objects, but it’s much more
 * efficient to use the standard icon theme for the #GdkScreen
 * so that the icon information is shared with other people
 * looking up icons.
