/**
 * Description
 * GtkIconTheme provides a facility for looking up icons by name
 * and size. The main reason for using a name rather than simply
 * providing a filename is to allow different icons to be used
 * depending on what icon theme is selected
 * by the user. The operation of icon themes on Linux and Unix
 * follows the Icon
 * Theme Specification. There is a default icon theme,
 * named hicolor where applications should install
 * their icons, but more additional application themes can be
 * installed as operating system vendors and users choose.
 * Named icons are similar to the Themeable Stock Images(3)
 * facility, and the distinction between the two may be a bit confusing.
 * A few things to keep in mind:
 * Stock images usually are used in conjunction with
 * Stock Items(3)., such as GTK_STOCK_OK or
 * GTK_STOCK_OPEN. Named icons are easier to set up and therefore
 * are more useful for new icons that an application wants to
 * add, such as application icons or window icons.
 * Stock images can only be loaded at the symbolic sizes defined
 * by the GtkIconSize enumeration, or by custom sizes defined
 * by gtk_icon_size_register(), while named icons are more flexible
 * and any pixel size can be specified.
 * Because stock images are closely tied to stock items, and thus
 * to actions in the user interface, stock images may come in
 * multiple variants for different widget states or writing
 * directions.
 * A good rule of thumb is that if there is a stock image for what
 * you want to use, use it, otherwise use a named icon. It turns
 * out that internally stock images are generally defined in
 * terms of one or more named icons. (An example of the
 * more than one case is icons that depend on writing direction;
 * GTK_STOCK_GO_FORWARD uses the two themed icons
 * "gtk-stock-go-forward-ltr" and "gtk-stock-go-forward-rtl".)
 * In many cases, named themes are used indirectly, via GtkImage
 * or stock items, rather than directly, but looking up icons
 * directly is also simple. The GtkIconTheme object acts
 * as a database of all the icons in the current theme. You
 * can create new GtkIconTheme objects, but its much more
 * efficient to use the standard icon theme for the GdkScreen
 * so that the icon information is shared with other people
 * looking up icons. In the case where the default screen is
 * being used, looking up an icon can be as simple as:
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
