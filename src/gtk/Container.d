/**
 * Description
 * A GTK+ user interface is constructed by nesting widgets inside widgets.
 * Container widgets are the inner nodes in the resulting tree of widgets:
 * they contain other widgets. So, for example, you might have a GtkWindow
 * containing a GtkFrame containing a GtkLabel. If you wanted an image instead
 * of a textual label inside the frame, you might replace the GtkLabel widget
 * with a GtkImage widget.
 * There are two major kinds of container widgets in GTK+. Both are subclasses
 * of the abstract GtkContainer base class.
 * The first type of container widget has a single child widget and derives
 * from GtkBin. These containers are decorators, which
 * add some kind of functionality to the child. For example, a GtkButton makes
 * its child into a clickable button; a GtkFrame draws a frame around its child
 * and a GtkWindow places its child widget inside a top-level window.
 * The second type of container can have more than one child; its purpose is to
 * manage layout. This means that these containers assign
 * sizes and positions to their children. For example, a GtkHBox arranges its
 * children in a horizontal row, and a GtkTable arranges the widgets it contains
 * in a two-dimensional grid.
 * To fulfill its task, a layout container must negotiate the size requirements
 * with its parent and its children. This negotiation is carried out in two
 * phases, size requisition and size
 * allocation.
 * Size Requisition
 * The size requisition of a widget is it's desired width and height.
 * This is represented by a GtkRequisition.
 * How a widget determines its desired size depends on the widget.
 * A GtkLabel, for example, requests enough space to display all its text.
 * Container widgets generally base their size request on the requisitions
 * of their children.
 * The size requisition phase of the widget layout process operates top-down.
 * It starts at a top-level widget, typically a GtkWindow. The top-level widget
 * asks its child for its size requisition by calling gtk_widget_size_request().
 * To determine its requisition, the child asks its own children for their
 * requisitions and so on. Finally, the top-level widget will get a requisition
 * back from its child.
 * <hr>
 * Size Allocation
 * When the top-level widget has determined how much space its child would like
 * to have, the second phase of the size negotiation, size allocation, begins.
 * Depending on its configuration (see gtk_window_set_resizable()), the top-level
 * widget may be able to expand in order to satisfy the size request or it may
 * have to ignore the size request and keep its fixed size. It then tells its
 * child widget how much space it gets by calling gtk_widget_size_allocate().
 * The child widget divides the space among its children and tells each child
 * how much space it got, and so on. Under normal circumstances, a GtkWindow
 * will always give its child the amount of space the child requested.
 * A child's size allocation is represented by a GtkAllocation. This struct
 * contains not only a width and height, but also a position (i.e. X and Y
 * coordinates), so that containers can tell their children not only how much
 * space they have gotten, but also where they are positioned inside the space
 * available to the container.
 * Widgets are required to honor the size allocation they receive; a size
 * request is only a request, and widgets must be able to cope with any size.
 * <hr>
 * Child properties
 * GtkContainer introduces child
 * properties - these are object properties that are not specific
 * to either the container or the contained widget, but rather to their relation.
 * Typical examples of child properties are the position or pack-type of a widget
 * which is contained in a GtkBox.
 * Use gtk_container_class_install_child_property() to install child properties
 * for a container class and gtk_container_class_find_child_property() or
 * gtk_container_class_list_child_properties() to get information about existing
 * child properties.
 * To set the value of a child property, use gtk_container_child_set_property(),
 * gtk_container_child_set() or gtk_container_child_set_valist().
 * To obtain the value of a child property, use
 * gtk_container_child_get_property(), gtk_container_child_get() or
 * gtk_container_child_get_valist(). To emit notification about child property
 * changes, use gtk_widget_child_notify().
 * <hr>
 * GtkContainer as GtkBuildable
 * The GtkContainer implementation of the GtkBuildable interface
 * supports a <packing> element for children, which can
 * contain multiple <property> elements that specify
 * child properties for the child.
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 * Since 2.16, child properties can also be marked as translatable using
 * the same "translatable", "comments" and "context" attributes that are used
 * for regular properties.
