/**
 * The #GtkClipboard object represents a clipboard of data shared
 * between different processes or between different widgets in
 * the same process. Each clipboard is identified by a name encoded as a
 * #GdkAtom. (Conversion to and from strings can be done with
 * gdk_atom_intern() and gdk_atom_name().) The default clipboard
 * corresponds to the “CLIPBOARD” atom; another commonly used clipboard
 * is the “PRIMARY” clipboard, which, in X, traditionally contains
 * the currently selected text.
 * 
 * To support having a number of different formats on the clipboard
 * at the same time, the clipboard mechanism allows providing
 * callbacks instead of the actual data.  When you set the contents
 * of the clipboard, you can either supply the data directly (via
 * functions like gtk_clipboard_set_text()), or you can supply a
 * callback to be called at a later time when the data is needed (via
 * gtk_clipboard_set_with_data() or gtk_clipboard_set_with_owner().)
 * Providing a callback also avoids having to make copies of the data
 * when it is not needed.
 * 
 * gtk_clipboard_set_with_data() and gtk_clipboard_set_with_owner()
 * are quite similar; the choice between the two depends mostly on
 * which is more convenient in a particular situation.
 * The former is most useful when you want to have a blob of data
 * with callbacks to convert it into the various data types that you
 * advertise. When the @clear_func you provided is called, you
 * simply free the data blob. The latter is more useful when the
 * contents of clipboard reflect the internal state of a #GObject
 * (As an example, for the PRIMARY clipboard, when an entry widget
 * provides the clipboard’s contents the contents are simply the
 * text within the selected region.) If the contents change, the
 * entry widget can call gtk_clipboard_set_with_owner() to update
 * the timestamp for clipboard ownership, without having to worry
 * about @clear_func being called.
 * 
 * Requesting the data from the clipboard is essentially
 * asynchronous. If the contents of the clipboard are provided within
 * the same process, then a direct function call will be made to
 * retrieve the data, but if they are provided by another process,
 * then the data needs to be retrieved from the other process, which
 * may take some time. To avoid blocking the user interface, the call
 * to request the selection, gtk_clipboard_request_contents() takes a
 * callback that will be called when the contents are received (or
 * when the request fails.) If you don’t want to deal with providing
 * a separate callback, you can also use gtk_clipboard_wait_for_contents().
 * What this does is run the GLib main loop recursively waiting for
 * the contents. This can simplify the code flow, but you still have
 * to be aware that other callbacks in your program can be called
 * while this recursive mainloop is running.
 * 
 * Along with the functions to get the clipboard contents as an
 * arbitrary data chunk, there are also functions to retrieve
 * it as text, gtk_clipboard_request_text() and
 * gtk_clipboard_wait_for_text(). These functions take care of
 * determining which formats are advertised by the clipboard
 * provider, asking for the clipboard in the best available format
 * and converting the results into the UTF-8 encoding. (The standard
 * form for representing strings in GTK+.)
