/**
 * Description
 *  The GtkClipboard object represents a clipboard of data shared
 *  between different processes or between different widgets in
 *  the same process. Each clipboard is identified by a name encoded as a
 *  GdkAtom. (Conversion to and from strings can be done with
 *  gdk_atom_intern() and gdk_atom_name().) The default clipboard
 *  corresponds to the "CLIPBOARD" atom; another commonly used clipboard
 *  is the "PRIMARY" clipboard, which, in X, traditionally contains
 *  the currently selected text.
 *  To support having a number of different formats on the clipboard
 *  at the same time, the clipboard mechanism allows providing
 *  callbacks instead of the actual data. When you set the contents
 *  of the clipboard, you can either supply the data directly (via
 *  functions like gtk_clipboard_set_text()), or you can supply a
 *  callback to be called at a later time when the data is needed (via
 *  gtk_clipboard_set_with_data() or gtk_clipboard_set_with_owner().)
 *  Providing a callback also avoids having to make copies of the data
 *  when it is not needed.
 *  gtk_clipboard_set_with_data() and gtk_clipboard_set_with_owner()
 *  are quite similar; the choice between the two depends mostly on
 *  which is more convenient in a particular situation.
 *  The former is most useful when you want to have a blob of data
 *  with callbacks to convert it into the various data types that you
 *  advertise. When the clear_func you provided is called, you
 *  simply free the data blob. The latter is more useful when the
 *  contents of clipboard reflect the internal state of a GObject
 *  (As an example, for the PRIMARY clipboard, when an entry widget
 *  provides the clipboard's contents the contents are simply the
 *  text within the selected region.) If the contents change, the
 *  entry widget can call gtk_clipboard_set_with_owner() to update
 *  the timestamp for clipboard ownership, without having to worry
 *  about clear_func being called.
 *  Requesting the data from the clipboard is essentially
 *  asynchronous. If the contents of the clipboard are provided within
 *  the same process, then a direct function call will be made to
 *  retrieve the data, but if they are provided by another process,
 *  then the data needs to be retrieved from the other process, which
 *  may take some time. To avoid blocking the user interface, the call
 *  to request the selection, gtk_clipboard_request_contents() takes a
 *  callback that will be called when the contents are received (or
 *  when the request fails.) If you don't want to deal with providing
 *  a separate callback, you can also use gtk_clipboard_wait_for_contents().
 *  What this does is run the GLib main loop recursively waiting for
 *  the contents. This can simplify the code flow, but you still have
 *  to be aware that other callbacks in your program can be called
 *  while this recursive mainloop is running.
 *  Along with the functions to get the clipboard contents as an
 *  arbitrary data chunk, there are also functions to retrieve
 *  it as text, gtk_clipboard_request_text() and
 *  gtk_clipboard_wait_for_text(). These functions take care of
 *  determining which formats are advertised by the clipboard
 *  provider, asking for the clipboard in the best available format
 *  and converting the results into the UTF-8 encoding. (The standard
 *  form for representing strings in GTK+.)
