/**
 * Description
 * You may wish to begin by reading the text widget
 * conceptual overview which gives an overview of all the objects and data
 * types related to the text widget and how they work together.
 * Tags should be in the GtkTextTagTable for a given GtkTextBuffer
 * before using them with that buffer.
 * gtk_text_buffer_create_tag() is the best way to create tags.
 * See gtk-demo for numerous examples.
 * The "invisible" property was not implemented for GTK+ 2.0.
 * It is working (with minor issues) since 2.8.
