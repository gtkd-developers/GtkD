/**
 * Description
 * GtkPaned is the base class for widgets with two panes,
 * arranged either horizontally (GtkHPaned) or
 * vertically (GtkVPaned). Child widgets are
 * added to the panes of the widget with
 * gtk_paned_pack1() and gtk_paned_pack2(). The division
 * beween the two children is set by default from the
 * size requests of the children, but it can be adjusted
 * by the user.
 * A paned widget draws a separator between the two
 * child widgets and a small handle that the user
 * can drag to adjust the division. It does not
 * draw any relief around the children or around
 * the separator. (The space in which the separator
 * is called the gutter.) Often, it is useful
 * to put each child inside a GtkFrame with the
 * shadow type set to GTK_SHADOW_IN so that the
 * gutter appears as a ridge. No separator is drawn
 * if one of the children is missing.
 * Each child has two options that can be set,
 * resize and shrink. If resize is true, then when the
 * GtkPaned is resized, that child will expand
 * or shrink along with the paned widget. If shrink
 * is true, then when that child can be made smaller
 * than its requisition by the user. Setting shrink
 * to FALSE allows the application to set a minimum
 * size. If resize is false for both children, then
 * this is treated as if resize is true for both
 * children.
 * The application can set the position of the slider
 * as if it were set by the user, by calling
 * gtk_paned_set_position().
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
