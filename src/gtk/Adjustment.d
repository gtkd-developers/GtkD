/**
 * Description
 * The GtkAdjustment object represents a value which has an associated lower
 * and upper bound, together with step and page increments, and a page size.
 * It is used within several GTK+ widgets, including
 * GtkSpinButton, GtkViewport, and GtkRange (which is a base class for
 * GtkHScrollbar, GtkVScrollbar, GtkHScale, and GtkVScale).
 * The GtkAdjustment object does not update the value itself. Instead
 * it is left up to the owner of the GtkAdjustment to control the value.
 * The owner of the GtkAdjustment typically calls the
 * gtk_adjustment_value_changed() and gtk_adjustment_changed() functions
 * after changing the value and its bounds. This results in the emission of the
 * "value_changed" or "changed" signal respectively.
