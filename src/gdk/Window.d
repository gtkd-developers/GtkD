/**
 * Description
 * A GdkWindow is a rectangular region on the screen. It's a low-level object,
 * used to implement high-level objects such as GtkWidget and GtkWindow on the
 * GTK+ level. A GtkWindow is a toplevel window, the thing a user might think of
 * as a "window" with a titlebar and so on; a GtkWindow may contain many GdkWindow.
 * For example, each GtkButton has a GdkWindow associated with it.
 * Composited Windows
 * Normally, the windowing system takes care of rendering the contents of a child
 * window onto its parent window. This mechanism can be intercepted by calling
 * gdk_window_set_composited() on the child window. For a
 * composited window it is the responsibility of the
 * application to render the window contents at the right spot.
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 * In the example Example 7, “Composited windows”, a button is
 * placed inside of an event box inside of a window. The event box is
 * set as composited and therefore is no longer automatically drawn to
 * the screen.
 * When the contents of the event box change, an expose event is
 * generated on its parent window (which, in this case, belongs to
 * the toplevel GtkWindow). The expose handler for this widget is
 * responsible for merging the changes back on the screen in the way
 * that it wishes.
 * In our case, we merge the contents with a 50% transparency. We
 * also set the background colour of the window to red. The effect is
 * that the background shows through the button.
 * <hr>
 * Offscreen Windows
 * Offscreen windows are more general than composited windows, since they
 * allow not only to modify the rendering of the child window onto its parent,
 * but also to apply coordinate transformations.
 * To integrate an offscreen window into a window hierarchy, one has to call
 * gdk_offscreen_window_set_embedder() and handle a number of signals. The
 * "pick-embedded-child" signal on the embedder window is used to
 * select an offscreen child at given coordinates, and the "to-embedder"
 * and "from-embedder" signals on the offscreen window are used to
 * translate coordinates between the embedder and the offscreen window.
 * For rendering an offscreen window onto its embedder, the contents of the
 * offscreen window are available as a pixmap, via
 * gdk_offscreen_window_get_pixmap().
