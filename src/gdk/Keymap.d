/**
 * Description
 * Key values are the codes which are sent whenever a key is pressed or released.
 * They appear in the keyval field of the
 * GdkEventKey structure, which is passed to signal handlers for the
 * "key-press-event" and "key-release-event" signals.
 * The complete list of key values can be found in the <gdk/gdkkeysyms.h>
 * header file. <gdk/gdkkeysyms.h> is not included in <gdk/gdk.h>,
 * it must be included independently, because the file is quite large.
 * Key values are regularly updated from the upstream X.org X11 implementation,
 * so new values are added regularly. They will be prefixed with GDK_ rather than
 * XF86XK_ or XK_ (for older symbols).
 * Key values can be converted into a string representation using
 * gdk_keyval_name(). The reverse function, converting a string to a key value,
 * is provided by gdk_keyval_from_name().
 * The case of key values can be determined using gdk_keyval_is_upper() and
 * gdk_keyval_is_lower(). Key values can be converted to upper or lower case
 * using gdk_keyval_to_upper() and gdk_keyval_to_lower().
 * When it makes sense, key values can be converted to and from
 * Unicode characters with gdk_keyval_to_unicode() and gdk_unicode_to_keyval().
 * One GdkKeymap object exists for each user display. gdk_keymap_get_default()
 * returns the GdkKeymap for the default display; to obtain keymaps for other
 * displays, use gdk_keymap_get_for_display(). A keymap
 * is a mapping from GdkKeymapKey to key values. You can think of a GdkKeymapKey
 * as a representation of a symbol printed on a physical keyboard key. That is, it
 * contains three pieces of information. First, it contains the hardware keycode;
 * this is an identifying number for a physical key. Second, it contains the
 * level of the key. The level indicates which symbol on the
 * key will be used, in a vertical direction. So on a standard US keyboard, the key
 * with the number "1" on it also has the exclamation point ("!") character on
 * it. The level indicates whether to use the "1" or the "!" symbol. The letter
 * keys are considered to have a lowercase letter at level 0, and an uppercase
 * letter at level 1, though only the uppercase letter is printed. Third, the
 * GdkKeymapKey contains a group; groups are not used on standard US keyboards,
 * but are used in many other countries. On a keyboard with groups, there can be 3
 * or 4 symbols printed on a single key. The group indicates movement in a
 * horizontal direction. Usually groups are used for two different languages. In
 * group 0, a key might have two English characters, and in group 1 it might have
 * two Hebrew characters. The Hebrew characters will be printed on the key next to
 * the English characters.
 * In order to use a keymap to interpret a key event, it's necessary to first
 * convert the keyboard state into an effective group and level. This is done via a
 * set of rules that varies widely according to type of keyboard and user
 * configuration. The function gdk_keymap_translate_keyboard_state() accepts a
 * keyboard state -- consisting of hardware keycode pressed, active modifiers, and
 * active group -- applies the appropriate rules, and returns the group/level to be
 * used to index the keymap, along with the modifiers which did not affect the
 * group and level. i.e. it returns "unconsumed modifiers." The keyboard group may
 * differ from the effective group used for keymap lookups because some keys don't
 * have multiple groups - e.g. the Enter key is always in group 0 regardless of
 * keyboard state.
 * Note that gdk_keymap_translate_keyboard_state() also returns the keyval, i.e. it
 * goes ahead and performs the keymap lookup in addition to telling you which
 * effective group/level values were used for the lookup. GdkEventKey already
 * contains this keyval, however, so you don't normally need to call
 * gdk_keymap_translate_keyboard_state() just to get the keyval.
