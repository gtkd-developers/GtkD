/**
 * Description
 * GObject is the fundamental type providing the common attributes and
 * methods for all object types in GTK+, Pango and other libraries
 * based on GObject. The GObject class provides methods for object
 * construction and destruction, property access methods, and signal
 * support. Signals are described in detail in Signals(3).
 * GInitiallyUnowned is derived from GObject. The only difference between
 * the two is that the initial reference of a GInitiallyUnowned is flagged
 * as a floating reference.
 * This means that it is not specifically claimed to be "owned" by
 * any code portion. The main motivation for providing floating references is
 * C convenience. In particular, it allows code to be written as:
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 * If container_add_child() will g_object_ref_sink() the
 * passed in child, no reference of the newly created child is leaked.
 * Without floating references, container_add_child()
 * can only g_object_ref() the new child, so to implement this code without
 * reference leaks, it would have to be written as:
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 * The floating reference can be converted into
 * an ordinary reference by calling g_object_ref_sink().
 * For already sunken objects (objects that don't have a floating reference
 * anymore), g_object_ref_sink() is equivalent to g_object_ref() and returns
 * a new reference.
 * Since floating references are useful almost exclusively for C convenience,
 * language bindings that provide automated reference and memory ownership
 * maintenance (such as smart pointers or garbage collection) therefore don't
 * need to expose floating references in their API.
 * Some object implementations may need to save an objects floating state
 * across certain code portions (an example is GtkMenu), to achive this, the
 * following sequence can be used:
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
