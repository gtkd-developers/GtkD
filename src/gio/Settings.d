/**
 * Description
 * The GSettings class provides a convenient API for storing and retrieving
 * application settings.
 * Reads and writes can be considered to be non-blocking. Reading
 * settings with GSettings is typically extremely fast: on
 * approximately the same order of magnitude (but slower than) a
 * GHashTable lookup. Writing settings is also extremely fast in terms
 * of time to return to your application, but can be extremely expensive
 * for other threads and other processes. Many settings backends
 * (including dconf) have lazy initialisation which means in the common
 * case of the user using their computer without modifying any settings
 * a lot of work can be avoided. For dconf, the D-Bus service doesn't
 * even need to be started in this case. For this reason, you should
 * only ever modify GSettings keys in response to explicit user action.
 * Particular care should be paid to ensure that modifications are not
 * made during startup -- for example, when settings the initial value
 * of preferences widgets. The built-in g_settings_bind() functionality
 * is careful not to write settings in response to notify signals as a
 * result of modifications that it makes to widgets.
 * When creating a GSettings instance, you have to specify a schema
 * that describes the keys in your settings and their types and default
 * values, as well as some other information.
 * Normally, a schema has as fixed path that determines where the settings
 * are stored in the conceptual global tree of settings. However, schemas
 * can also be 'relocatable', i.e. not equipped with a fixed path. This is
 * useful e.g. when the schema describes an 'account', and you want to be
 * able to store a arbitrary number of accounts.
 * Unlike other configuration systems (like GConf), GSettings does not
 * restrict keys to basic types like strings and numbers. GSettings stores
 * values as GVariant, and allows any GVariantType for keys. Key names
 * are restricted to lowercase characters, numbers and '-'. Furthermore,
 * the names must begin with a lowercase character, must not end
 * with a '-', and must not contain consecutive dashes. Key names can
 * be up to 32 characters long.
 * Similar to GConf, the default values in GSettings schemas can be
 * localized, but the localized values are stored in gettext catalogs
 * and looked up with the domain that is specified in the
 * gettext-domain attribute of the
 * <schemalist> or <schema>
 * elements and the category that is specified in the l10n attribute of the
 * <key> element.
 * GSettings uses schemas in a compact binary form that is created
 * by the glib-compile-schemas
 * utility. The input is a schema description in an XML format that can be
 * described by the following DTD:
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 * glib-compile-schemas expects schema files to have the extension .gschema.xml
 * At runtime, schemas are identified by their id (as specified
 * in the id attribute of the
 * <schema> element). The
 * convention for schema ids is to use a dotted name, similar in
 * style to a D-Bus bus name, e.g. "org.gnome.SessionManager". In particular,
 * if the settings are for a specific service that owns a D-Bus bus name,
 * the D-Bus bus name and schema id should match. For schemas which deal
 * with settings not associated with one named application, the id should
 * not use StudlyCaps, e.g. "org.gnome.font-rendering".
 * In addition to GVariant types, keys can have types that have enumerated
 * types. These can be described by a <choice>,
 * <enum> or <flags> element, see
 *  Example 12, “Ranges, choices and enumerated types”. The underlying type of
 * such a key is string, but you can use g_settings_get_enum(),
 * g_settings_set_enum(), g_settings_get_flags(), g_settings_set_flags()
 * access the numeric values corresponding to the string value of enum
 * and flags keys.
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 * Vendor overrides
 *  Default values are defined in the schemas that get installed by
 *  an application. Sometimes, it is necessary for a vendor or distributor
 *  to adjust these defaults. Since patching the XML source for the schema
 *  is inconvenient and error-prone,
 *  glib-compile-schemas reads
 *  so-called 'vendor override' files. These are keyfiles in the same
 *  directory as the XML schema sources which can override default values.
 *  The schema id serves as the group name in the key file, and the values
 *  are expected in serialized GVariant form, as in the following example:
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 *  glib-compile-schemas expects schema files to have the extension
 *  .gschema.override
 * Binding
 *  A very convenient feature of GSettings lets you bind GObject properties
 *  directly to settings, using g_settings_bind(). Once a GObject property
 *  has been bound to a setting, changes on either side are automatically
 *  propagated to the other side. GSettings handles details like
 *  mapping between GObject and GVariant types, and preventing infinite
 *  cycles.
 *  This makes it very easy to hook up a preferences dialog to the
 *  underlying settings. To make this even more convenient, GSettings
 *  looks for a boolean property with the name "sensitivity" and
 *  automatically binds it to the writability of the bound setting.
 *  If this 'magic' gets in the way, it can be suppressed with the
 *  G_SETTINGS_BIND_NO_SENSITIVITY flag.
