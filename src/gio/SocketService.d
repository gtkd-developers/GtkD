/**
 * Description
 * A GSocketService is an object that represents a service that is
 * provided to the network or over local sockets. When a new
 * connection is made to the service the "incoming"
 * signal is emitted.
 * A GSocketService is a subclass of GSocketListener and you need
 * to add the addresses you want to accept connections on to the
 * with the GSocketListener APIs.
 * There are two options for implementing a network service based on
 * GSocketService. The first is to create the service using
 * g_socket_service_new() and to connect to the "incoming"
 * signal. The second is to subclass GSocketService and override the
 * default signal handler implementation.
 * In either case, the handler must immediately return, or else it
 * will block additional incoming connections from being serviced.
 * If you are interested in writing connection handlers that contain
 * blocking code then see GThreadedSocketService.
 * The socket service runs on the main loop in the main thread, and is
 * not threadsafe in general. However, the calls to start and stop
 * the service are threadsafe so these can be used from threads that
 * handle incoming clients.
