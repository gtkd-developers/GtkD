/**
 * #GDtlsConnection is the base DTLS connection class type, which wraps
 * a #GDatagramBased and provides DTLS encryption on top of it. Its
 * subclasses, #GDtlsClientConnection and #GDtlsServerConnection,
 * implement client-side and server-side DTLS, respectively.
 * 
 * For TLS support, see #GTlsConnection.
 * 
 * As DTLS is datagram based, #GDtlsConnection implements #GDatagramBased,
 * presenting a datagram-socket-like API for the encrypted connection. This
 * operates over a base datagram connection, which is also a #GDatagramBased
 * (#GDtlsConnection:base-socket).
 * 
 * To close a DTLS connection, use g_dtls_connection_close().
 * 
 * Neither #GDtlsServerConnection or #GDtlsClientConnection set the peer address
 * on their base #GDatagramBased if it is a #GSocket â€” it is up to the caller to
 * do that if they wish. If they do not, and g_socket_close() is called on the
 * base socket, the #GDtlsConnection will not raise a %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_CONNECTED
 * error on further I/O.
