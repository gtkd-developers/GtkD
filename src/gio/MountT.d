/**
 * Description
 * The GMount interface represents user-visible mounts. Note, when
 * porting from GnomeVFS, GMount is the moral equivalent of GnomeVFSVolume.
 * GMount is a "mounted" filesystem that you can access. Mounted is in
 * quotes because it's not the same as a unix mount, it might be a gvfs
 * mount, but you can still access the files on it if you use GIO. Might or
 * might not be related to a volume object.
 * Unmounting a GMount instance is an asynchronous operation. For
 * more information about asynchronous operations, see GAsyncReady
 * and GSimpleAsyncReady. To unmount a GMount instance, first call
 * g_mount_unmount_with_operation() with (at least) the GMount instance and a
 * GAsyncReadyCallback. The callback will be fired when the
 * operation has resolved (either with success or failure), and a
 * GAsyncReady structure will be passed to the callback. That
 * callback should then call g_mount_unmount_with_operation_finish() with the GMount
 * and the GAsyncReady data to see if the operation was completed
 * successfully. If an error is present when g_mount_unmount_with_operation_finish()
 * is called, then it will be filled with any error information.

	 * One application of shadow mounts is when exposing a single file
	 * system that is used to address several logical volumes. In this
	 * situation, a GVolumeMonitor implementation would create two
	 * GVolume objects (for example, one for the camera functionality of
	 * the device and one for a SD card reader on the device) with
	 * activation URIs gphoto2://[usb:001,002]/store1/
	 * and gphoto2://[usb:001,002]/store2/. When the
	 * underlying mount (with root
	 * gphoto2://[usb:001,002]/) is mounted, said
	 * GVolumeMonitor implementation would create two GMount objects
	 * (each with their root matching the corresponding volume activation
	 * root) that would shadow the original mount.
	 * The proxy monitor in GVfs 2.26 and later, automatically creates and
	 * manage shadow mounts (and shadows the underlying mount) if the
	 * activation root on a GVolume is set.
	 * Since 2.20
	 * Returns: TRUE if mount is shadowed.
