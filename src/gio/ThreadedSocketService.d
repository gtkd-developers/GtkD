/**
 * Description
 * A GThreadedSocketService is a simple subclass of GSocketService
 * that handles incoming connections by creating a worker thread and
 * dispatching the connection to it by emitting the ::run signal in
 * the new thread.
 * The signal handler may perform blocking IO and need not return
 * until the connection is closed.
 * The service is implemented using a thread pool, so there is a
 * limited amount of threads availible to serve incomming requests.
 * The service automatically stops the GSocketService from accepting
 * new connections when all threads are busy.
 * As with GSocketService, you may connect to "run",
 * or subclass and override the default handler.
