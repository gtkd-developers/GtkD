/**
 * Values corresponding to errno codes returned from file operations

 * sort of file operation you were performing; the UNIX documentation
 * gives more details. The following error code descriptions come
 * from the GNU C Library manual, and are under the copyright
 * of that manual.
 * It's not very portable to make detailed assumptions about exactly
 * which errors will be returned from a given operation. Some errors
 * don't occur on some systems, etc., sometimes there are subtle
 * differences in when a system will report a given error, etc.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_EXIST
 * Operation not permitted; only the owner of the
 *  file (or other resource) or processes with special privileges can
 *  perform the operation.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_ISDIR
 * File is a directory; you cannot open a directory
 *  for writing, or create or remove hard links to it.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_ACCES
 * Permission denied; the file permissions do not
 *  allow the attempted operation.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_NAMETOOLONG
 * Filename too long.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_NOENT
 * No such file or directory. This is a "file
 *  doesn't exist" error for ordinary files that are referenced in
 *  contexts where they are expected to already exist.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_NOTDIR
 * A file that isn't a directory was specified when
 *  a directory is required.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_NXIO
 * No such device or address. The system tried to
 *  use the device represented by a file you specified, and it
 *  couldn't find the device. This can mean that the device file was
 *  installed incorrectly, or that the physical device is missing or
 *  not correctly attached to the computer.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_NODEV
 * This file is of a type that doesn't support
 *  mapping.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_ROFS
 * The directory containing the new link can't be
 *  modified because it's on a read-only file system.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_TXTBSY
 * Text file busy.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_FAULT
 * You passed in a pointer to bad memory.
 *  (GLib won't reliably return this, don't pass in pointers to bad
 *  memory.)
 * G_FILE_ERROR_LOOP
 * Too many levels of symbolic links were encountered
 *  in looking up a file name. This often indicates a cycle of symbolic
 *  links.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_NOSPC
 * No space left on device; write operation on a
 *  file failed because the disk is full.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_NOMEM
 * No memory available. The system cannot allocate
 *  more virtual memory because its capacity is full.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_MFILE
 * The current process has too many files open and
 *  can't open any more. Duplicate descriptors do count toward this
 *  limit.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_NFILE
 * There are too many distinct file openings in the
 *  entire system.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_BADF
 * Bad file descriptor; for example, I/O on a
 *  descriptor that has been closed or reading from a descriptor open
 *  only for writing (or vice versa).
 * G_FILE_ERROR_INVAL
 * Invalid argument. This is used to indicate
 *  various kinds of problems with passing the wrong argument to a
 *  library function.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_PIPE
 * Broken pipe; there is no process reading from the
 *  other end of a pipe. Every library function that returns this
 *  error code also generates a `SIGPIPE' signal; this signal
 *  terminates the program if not handled or blocked. Thus, your
 *  program will never actually see this code unless it has handled or
 *  blocked `SIGPIPE'.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_AGAIN
 * Resource temporarily unavailable; the call might
 *  work if you try again later.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_INTR
 * Interrupted function call; an asynchronous signal
 *  occurred and prevented completion of the call. When this
 *  happens, you should try the call again.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_IO
 * Input/output error; usually used for physical read
 *  or write errors. i.e. the disk or other physical device hardware
 *  is returning errors.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_PERM
 * Operation not permitted; only the owner of the
 *  file (or other resource) or processes with special privileges can
 *  perform the operation.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_NOSYS
 * Function not implemented; this indicates that the
 *  system is missing some functionality.
 * G_FILE_ERROR_FAILED
 * Does not correspond to a UNIX error code; this
 *  is the standard "failed for unspecified reason" error code present in
 *  all GError error code enumerations. Returned if no specific
 *  code applies.

/**
 * Flags specifying compile-time options.
 * G_REGEX_CASELESS
 * Letters in the pattern match both upper- and
 *  lowercase letters. This option can be changed within a pattern
 *  by a "(?i)" option setting.
 * G_REGEX_MULTILINE
 * By default, GRegex treats the strings as consisting
 *  of a single line of characters (even if it actually contains
 *  newlines). The "start of line" metacharacter ("^") matches only
 *  at the start of the string, while the "end of line" metacharacter
 *  ("$") matches only at the end of the string, or before a terminating
 *  newline (unless G_REGEX_DOLLAR_ENDONLY is set). When
 *  G_REGEX_MULTILINE is set, the "start of line" and "end of line"
 *  constructs match immediately following or immediately before any
 *  newline in the string, respectively, as well as at the very start
 *  and end. This can be changed within a pattern by a "(?m)" option
 *  setting.
 * G_REGEX_DOTALL
 * A dot metacharater (".") in the pattern matches all
 *  characters, including newlines. Without it, newlines are excluded.
 *  This option can be changed within a pattern by a ("?s") option setting.
 * G_REGEX_EXTENDED
 * Whitespace data characters in the pattern are
 *  totally ignored except when escaped or inside a character class.
 *  Whitespace does not include the VT character (code 11). In addition,
 *  characters between an unescaped "#" outside a character class and
 *  the next newline character, inclusive, are also ignored. This can
 *  be changed within a pattern by a "(?x)" option setting.
 * G_REGEX_ANCHORED
 * The pattern is forced to be "anchored", that is,
 *  it is constrained to match only at the first matching point in the
 *  string that is being searched. This effect can also be achieved by
 *  appropriate constructs in the pattern itself such as the "^"
 *  metacharater.
 * G_REGEX_DOLLAR_ENDONLY
 * A dollar metacharacter ("$") in the pattern
 *  matches only at the end of the string. Without this option, a
 *  dollar also matches immediately before the final character if
 *  it is a newline (but not before any other newlines). This option
 *  is ignored if G_REGEX_MULTILINE is set.
 * G_REGEX_UNGREEDY
 * Inverts the "greediness" of the quantifiers so that
 *  they are not greedy by default, but become greedy if followed by "?".
 *  It can also be set by a "(?U)" option setting within the pattern.
 * G_REGEX_RAW
 * Usually strings must be valid UTF-8 strings, using this
 *  flag they are considered as a raw sequence of bytes.
 * G_REGEX_NO_AUTO_CAPTURE
 * Disables the use of numbered capturing
 *  parentheses in the pattern. Any opening parenthesis that is not
 *  followed by "?" behaves as if it were followed by "?:" but named
 *  parentheses can still be used for capturing (and they acquire numbers
 *  in the usual way).
 * G_REGEX_OPTIMIZE
 * Optimize the regular expression. If the pattern will
 *  be used many times, then it may be worth the effort to optimize it
 *  to improve the speed of matches.
 * G_REGEX_DUPNAMES
 * Names used to identify capturing subpatterns need not
 *  be unique. This can be helpful for certain types of pattern when it
 *  is known that only one instance of the named subpattern can ever be
 *  matched.
 * G_REGEX_NEWLINE_CR
 * Usually any newline character is recognized, if this
 *  option is set, the only recognized newline character is '\r'.
 * G_REGEX_NEWLINE_LF
 * Usually any newline character is recognized, if this
 *  option is set, the only recognized newline character is '\n'.
 * G_REGEX_NEWLINE_CRLF
 * Usually any newline character is recognized, if this
 *  option is set, the only recognized newline character sequence is '\r\n'.
 * Since 2.14

 * Specifies that first character of the string is

 * G_REGEX_MATCH_NOTEOL
 * Specifies that the end of the subject string is
 *  not the end of a line, so the dollar metacharacter should not match
 *  it nor (except in multiline mode) a newline immediately before it.
 *  Setting this without G_REGEX_MULTILINE (at compile time) causes
 *  dollar never to match. This option affects only the behaviour of
 *  the dollar metacharacter, it does not affect "\Z" or "\z".
 * G_REGEX_MATCH_NOTEMPTY
 * An empty string is not considered to be a valid
 *  match if this option is set. If there are alternatives in the pattern,
 *  they are tried. If all the alternatives match the empty string, the
 *  entire match fails. For example, if the pattern "a?b?" is applied to
 *  a string not beginning with "a" or "b", it matches the empty string
 *  at the start of the string. With this flag set, this match is not
 *  valid, so GRegex searches further into the string for occurrences

 * G_REGEX_MATCH_PARTIAL
 * Turns on the partial matching feature, for more

 * G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_CR
