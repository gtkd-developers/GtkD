/**
 * typedef guint32			 GdkWChar;
 * Specifies a wide character type, used to represent character codes.
 * This is needed since some native languages have character sets which have
 * more than 256 characters (Japanese and Chinese, for example).
 * Wide character values between 0 and 127 are always identical in meaning to
 * the ASCII character codes. The wide character value 0 is often used to
 * terminate strings of wide characters in a similar way to normal strings
 * using the char type.
 * An alternative to wide characters is multi-byte characters, which extend
 * normal char strings to cope with larger character sets. As the name suggests,
 * multi-byte characters use a different number of bytes to store different
 * character codes. For example codes 0-127 (i.e. the ASCII codes) often
 * use just one byte of memory, while other codes may use 2, 3 or even 4 bytes.
 * Multi-byte characters have the advantage that they can often be used in an
 * application with little change, since strings are still represented as arrays
 * of char values. However multi-byte strings are much easier to manipulate since
 * the character are all of the same size.
 * Applications typically use wide characters to represent character codes
 * internally, and multi-byte strings when saving the characters to a file.
 * The gdk_wcstombs() and gdk_mbstowcs() functions can be used to convert from
 * one representation to the other.
 * See the 'Extended Characters' section of the GNU C Library Reference Manual
 * for more detailed information on wide and multi-byte characters.

/**
 * The GdkGeometry struct gives the window manager information about

 * gdk_window_set_geometry_hints() expects the hints to be fully valid already and
 * simply passes them to the window manager; in contrast,
 * gtk_window_set_geometry_hints() performs some interpretation. For example,
 * GtkWindow will apply the hints to the geometry widget instead of the toplevel
 * window, if you set a geometry widget. Also, the
 * min_width/min_height/max_width/max_height fields may be set to -1, and
 * GtkWindow will substitute the size request of the window or geometry widget. If
 * the minimum size hint is not provided, GtkWindow will use its requisition as
 * the minimum size. If the minimum size is provided and a geometry widget is set,
 * GtkWindow will take the minimum size as the minimum size of the geometry widget
 * rather than the entire window. The base size is treated similarly.
 * The canonical use-case for gtk_window_set_geometry_hints() is to get a terminal
 * widget to resize properly. Here, the terminal text area should be the geometry
 * widget; GtkWindow will then automatically set the base size to the size of
 * other widgets in the terminal window, such as the menubar and scrollbar. Then,
 * the width_inc and height_inc fields should be set to the size of one character
 * in the terminal. Finally, the base size should be set to the size of one
 * character. The net effect is that the minimum size of the terminal
 * will have a 1x1 character terminal area, and only terminal sizes on
 * the "character grid" will be allowed.
 * Here's an example of how the terminal example would be implemented, assuming
 * a terminal area widget called "terminal" and a toplevel window "toplevel":
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 * The other useful fields are the min_aspect and max_aspect fields; these
 * contain a width/height ratio as a floating point number. If a geometry widget is
 * set, the aspect applies to the geometry widget rather than the entire window.
 * The most common use of these hints is probably to set min_aspect and
 * max_aspect to the same value, thus forcing the window to keep a constant aspect
 * ratio.
