/**
 * Description
 * An interface used for objects which implement linking between multiple
 * resource or content locations, or multiple 'markers' within a single
 * document. A Hypertext instance is associated with one or more Hyperlinks,
 * which are associated with particular offsets within the Hypertext's included
 * content. While this interface is derived from Text, there is no requirement that Hypertext instances have textual content; they may implement Image as well, and Hyperlinks need not have non-zero text offsets.
