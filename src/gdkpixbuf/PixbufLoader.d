/**
 * Description
 * GdkPixbufLoader provides a way for applications to drive the
 * process of loading an image, by letting them send the image data
 * directly to the loader instead of having the loader read the data
 * from a file. Applications can use this functionality instead of
 * gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file() or gdk_pixbuf_animation_new_from_file()
 * when they need to parse image data in
 * small chunks. For example, it should be used when reading an
 * image from a (potentially) slow network connection, or when
 * loading an extremely large file.
 * To use GdkPixbufLoader to load an image, just create a new one,
 * and call gdk_pixbuf_loader_write() to send the data to it. When
 * done, gdk_pixbuf_loader_close() should be called to end the stream
 * and finalize everything. The loader will emit three important
 * signals throughout the process. The first, "size_prepared",
 * will be called as soon as the image has enough information to
 * determine the size of the image to be used. If you want to scale
 * the image while loading it, you can call gdk_pixbuf_loader_set_size()
 * in response to this signal.
 * The second signal, "area_prepared",
 * will be called as soon as the pixbuf of the desired has been
 * allocated. You can obtain it by calling gdk_pixbuf_loader_get_pixbuf().
 * If you want to use it, simply ref it.
 * In addition, no actual information will be passed in yet, so the
 * pixbuf can be safely filled with any temporary graphics (or an
 * initial color) as needed. You can also call
 * gdk_pixbuf_loader_get_pixbuf() later and get the same pixbuf.
 * The last signal, "area_updated" gets
 * called every time a region is updated. This way you can update a
 * partially completed image. Note that you do not know anything
 * about the completeness of an image from the area updated. For
 * example, in an interlaced image, you need to make several passes
 * before the image is done loading.
 * Loading an animation
 * Loading an animation is almost as easy as loading an
 * image. Once the first "area_prepared" signal
 * has been emitted, you can call gdk_pixbuf_loader_get_animation()
 * to get the GdkPixbufAnimation struct and gdk_pixbuf_animation_get_iter()
 * to get an GdkPixbufAnimationIter for displaying it.
