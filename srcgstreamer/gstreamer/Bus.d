/**
 * Description
 * The GstBus is an object responsible for delivering GstMessages in
 * a first-in first-out way from the streaming threads to the application.
 * Since the application typically only wants to deal with delivery of these
 * messages from one thread, the GstBus will marshall the messages between
 * different threads. This is important since the actual streaming of media
 * is done in another thread than the application.
 * The GstBus provides support for GSource based notifications. This makes it
 * possible to handle the delivery in the glib mainloop.
 * The GSource callback function gst_bus_async_signal_func() can be used to
 * convert all bus messages into signal emissions.
 * A message is posted on the bus with the gst_bus_post() method. With the
 * gst_bus_peek() and gst_bus_pop() methods one can look at or retrieve a
 * previously posted message.
 * The bus can be polled with the gst_bus_poll() method. This methods blocks
 * up to the specified timeout value until one of the specified messages types
 * is posted on the bus. The application can then _pop() the messages from the
 * bus to handle them.
 * Alternatively the application can register an asynchronous bus function
 * using gst_bus_add_watch_full() or gst_bus_add_watch(). This function will
 * install a GSource in the default glib main loop and will deliver messages
 * a short while after they have been posted. Note that the main loop should
 * be running for the asynchronous callbacks.
 * It is also possible to get messages from the bus without any thread
 * marshalling with the gst_bus_set_sync_handler() method. This makes it
 * possible to react to a message in the same thread that posted the
 * message on the bus. This should only be used if the application is able
 * to deal with messages from different threads.
 * Every GstPipeline has one bus.
 * Note that a GstPipeline will set its bus into flushing state when changing
 * from READY to NULL state.
