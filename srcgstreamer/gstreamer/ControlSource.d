/**
 * The #GstControlSource is a base class for control value sources that could
 * be used to get timestamp-value pairs. A control source essentially is a
 * function over time.
 * 
 * A #GstControlSource is used by first getting an instance of a specific
 * control-source, creating a binding for the control-source to the target property
 * of the element and then adding the binding to the element. The binding will
 * convert the data types and value range to fit to the bound property.
 * 
 * For implementing a new #GstControlSource one has to implement
 * #GstControlSourceGetValue and #GstControlSourceGetValueArray functions.
 * These are then used by gst_control_source_get_value() and
 * gst_control_source_get_value_array() to get values for specific timestamps.
