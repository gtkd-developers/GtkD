/**
 * Description
 * One registry holds the metadata of a set of plugins.
 * All registries build the GstRegistryPool.
 * Design:
 * The GstRegistry object is a list of plugins and some functions for dealing
 * with them. GstPlugins are matched 1-1 with a file on disk, and may or may
 * not be loaded at a given time. There may be multiple GstRegistry objects,
 * but the "default registry" is the only object that has any meaning to the
 * core.
 * The registry.xml file is actually a cache of plugin information. This is
 * unlike versions prior to 0.10, where the registry file was the primary source
 * of plugin information, and was created by the gst-register command.
 * The primary source, at all times, of plugin information is each plugin file
 * itself. Thus, if an application wants information about a particular plugin,
 * or wants to search for a feature that satisfies given criteria, the primary
 * means of doing so is to load every plugin and look at the resulting
 * information that is gathered in the default registry. Clearly, this is a time
 * consuming process, so we cache information in the registry.xml file.
 * On startup, plugins are searched for in the plugin search path. This path can
 * be set directly using the GST_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable. The registry
 * file is loaded from ~/.gstreamer-$GST_MAJORMINOR/registry-$ARCH.xml or the
 * file listed in the GST_REGISTRY env var. The only reason to change the
 * registry location is for testing.
 * For each plugin that is found in the plugin search path, there could be 3
 * possibilities for cached information:
 * the cache may not contain information about a given file.
 * the cache may have stale information.
 * the cache may have current information.
 * In the first two cases, the plugin is loaded and the cache updated. In
 * addition to these cases, the cache may have entries for plugins that are not
 * relevant to the current process. These are marked as not available to the
 * current process. If the cache is updated for whatever reason, it is marked
 * dirty.
 * A dirty cache is written out at the end of initialization. Each entry is
 * checked to make sure the information is minimally valid. If not, the entry is
 * simply dropped.
 * Implementation notes:
 * The "cache" and "default registry" are different concepts and can represent
 * different sets of plugins. For various reasons, at init time, the cache is
 * stored in the default registry, and plugins not relevant to the current
 * process are marked with the GST_PLUGIN_FLAG_CACHED bit. These plugins are
 * removed at the end of intitialization.
