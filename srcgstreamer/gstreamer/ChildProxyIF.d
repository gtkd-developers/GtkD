/**
 * This interface abstracts handling of property sets for elements with
 * children. Imagine elements such as mixers or polyphonic generators. They all
 * have multiple #GstPad or some kind of voice objects. Another use case are
 * container elements like #GstBin.
 * The element implementing the interface acts as a parent for those child
 * objects.
 * 
 * By implementing this interface the child properties can be accessed from the
 * parent element by using gst_child_proxy_get() and gst_child_proxy_set().
 * 
 * Property names are written as "child-name::property-name". The whole naming
 * scheme is recursive. Thus "child1::child2::property" is valid too, if
 * "child1" and "child2" implement the #GstChildProxy interface.
