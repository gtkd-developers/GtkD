Release: 2.4.1
--------------
-Fix memory leak with gdk.Pixbuf.
-On Windows search for an copy of GTK+ in &lt;exe path&gt;\gtk.

Release: 2.4.0
--------------
- Calling unsupported functions now throws an Error.
- Add a Scoped overload for addOnDraw.
    Since the GC can keep a lot of Contexts alive before a collection cycle
    starts, some memory and GDI/X11 handles arn't released when no longer
    needed.
    The Scoped overload destroys the Context at the end of the call
    releasing there resources.
- Avoid DLL issues on Windows.
    GtkD now searches for the correct copy of Gtk+.
- Add a toArray function to glib.ListG and glib.ListSG.
- Add VTE binding, provided by Deadalnix.
- Remove D1 support.
    There are a few reasons to do this:
    1. All three compilers have discontinued there D1 version.
    2. GtkD with D1 + Tango has been broken for a year now, without any complain
    3. I hope to better support D2 features like const, imutable, nothrow, pure.
- bug fixes.
