/**
 * cairo_surface_t is the abstract type representing all different drawing

 *
 * A cairo surface is created by using backend-specific
 * constructors, typically of the form
 * cairo_backend_surface_create().
 *
 * Most surface types allow accessing the surface without using Cairo

 * you must use cairo_surface_mark_dirty() after modifying it.
