/**
 * #GVariantDict is a mutable interface to #GVariant dictionaries.
 * 
 * It can be used for doing a sequence of dictionary lookups in an
 * efficient way on an existing #GVariant dictionary or it can be used
 * to construct new dictionaries with a hashtable-like interface.  It
 * can also be used for taking existing dictionaries and modifying them
 * in order to create new ones.
 * 
 * #GVariantDict can only be used with %G_VARIANT_TYPE_VARDICT
 * dictionaries.
 * 
 * It is possible to use #GVariantDict allocated on the stack or on the
 * heap.  When using a stack-allocated #GVariantDict, you begin with a
 * call to g_variant_dict_init() and free the resources with a call to
 * g_variant_dict_clear().
 * 
 * Heap-allocated #GVariantDict follows normal refcounting rules: you
 * allocate it with g_variant_dict_new() and use g_variant_dict_ref()
 * and g_variant_dict_unref().
 * 
 * g_variant_dict_end() is used to convert the #GVariantDict back into a
 * dictionary-type #GVariant.  When used with stack-allocated instances,
 * this also implicitly frees all associated memory, but for
 * heap-allocated instances, you must still call g_variant_dict_unref()
 * afterwards.
 * 
 * You will typically want to use a heap-allocated #GVariantDict when
 * you expose it as part of an API.  For most other uses, the
 * stack-allocated form will be more convenient.
 * 
 * Consider the following two examples that do the same thing in each
 * style: take an existing dictionary and look up the "count" uint32
 * key, adding 1 to it if it is found, or returning an error if the
 * key is not found.  Each returns the new dictionary as a floating
 * #GVariant.
