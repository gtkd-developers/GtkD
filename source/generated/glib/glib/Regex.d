/**
 * The g_regex_*() functions implement regular
 * expression pattern matching using syntax and semantics similar to
 * Perl regular expression.
 * 
 * Some functions accept a @start_position argument, setting it differs
 * from just passing over a shortened string and setting %G_REGEX_MATCH_NOTBOL
 * in the case of a pattern that begins with any kind of lookbehind assertion.
 * For example, consider the pattern "\Biss\B" which finds occurrences of "iss"
 * in the middle of words. ("\B" matches only if the current position in the
 * subject is not a word boundary.) When applied to the string "Mississipi"
 * from the fourth byte, namely "issipi", it does not match, because "\B" is
 * always false at the start of the subject, which is deemed to be a word
 * boundary. However, if the entire string is passed , but with
 * @start_position set to 4, it finds the second occurrence of "iss" because
 * it is able to look behind the starting point to discover that it is
 * preceded by a letter.
 * 
 * Note that, unless you set the %G_REGEX_RAW flag, all the strings passed
 * to these functions must be encoded in UTF-8. The lengths and the positions
 * inside the strings are in bytes and not in characters, so, for instance,
 * "\xc3\xa0" (i.e. "Ã ") is two bytes long but it is treated as a
 * single character. If you set %G_REGEX_RAW the strings can be non-valid
 * UTF-8 strings and a byte is treated as a character, so "\xc3\xa0" is two
 * bytes and two characters long.
 * 
 * When matching a pattern, "\n" matches only against a "\n" character in
 * the string, and "\r" matches only a "\r" character. To match any newline
 * sequence use "\R". This particular group matches either the two-character
 * sequence CR + LF ("\r\n"), or one of the single characters LF (linefeed,
 * U+000A, "\n"), VT vertical tab, U+000B, "\v"), FF (formfeed, U+000C, "\f"),
 * CR (carriage return, U+000D, "\r"), NEL (next line, U+0085), LS (line
 * separator, U+2028), or PS (paragraph separator, U+2029).
 * 
 * The behaviour of the dot, circumflex, and dollar metacharacters are
 * affected by newline characters, the default is to recognize any newline
 * character (the same characters recognized by "\R"). This can be changed
 * with %G_REGEX_NEWLINE_CR, %G_REGEX_NEWLINE_LF and %G_REGEX_NEWLINE_CRLF
 * compile options, and with %G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_ANY,
 * %G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_CR, %G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_LF and
 * %G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_CRLF match options. These settings are also
 * relevant when compiling a pattern if %G_REGEX_EXTENDED is set, and an
 * unescaped "#" outside a character class is encountered. This indicates
 * a comment that lasts until after the next newline.
 * 
 * When setting the %G_REGEX_JAVASCRIPT_COMPAT flag, pattern syntax and pattern
 * matching is changed to be compatible with the way that regular expressions
 * work in JavaScript. More precisely, a lonely ']' character in the pattern
 * is a syntax error; the '\x' escape only allows 0 to 2 hexadecimal digits, and
 * you must use the '\u' escape sequence with 4 hex digits to specify a unicode
 * codepoint instead of '\x' or 'x{....}'. If '\x' or '\u' are not followed by
 * the specified number of hex digits, they match 'x' and 'u' literally; also
 * '\U' always matches 'U' instead of being an error in the pattern. Finally,
 * pattern matching is modified so that back references to an unset subpattern
 * group produces a match with the empty string instead of an error. See
 * pcreapi(3) for more information.
 * 
 * Creating and manipulating the same #GRegex structure from different
 * threads is not a problem as #GRegex does not modify its internal
 * state between creation and destruction, on the other hand #GMatchInfo
 * is not threadsafe.
 * 
 * The regular expressions low-level functionalities are obtained through
 * the excellent
 * [PCRE](http://www.pcre.org/)
 * library written by Philip Hazel.
