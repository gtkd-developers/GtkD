	/**
	 * Specifies a function to be called at normal program termination.
	 *
	 * Since GLib 2.8.2, on Windows g_atexit() actually is a preprocessor
	 * macro that maps to a call to the atexit() function in the C
	 * library. This means that in case the code that calls g_atexit(),
	 * i.e. atexit(), is in a DLL, the function will be called when the
	 * DLL is detached from the program. This typically makes more sense
	 * than that the function is called when the GLib DLL is detached,
	 * which happened earlier when g_atexit() was a function in the GLib
	 * DLL.
	 *
	 * The behaviour of atexit() in the context of dynamically loaded
	 * modules is not formally specified and varies wildly.
	 *
	 * On POSIX systems, calling g_atexit() (or atexit()) in a dynamically
	 * loaded module which is unloaded before the program terminates might
	 * well cause a crash at program exit.
	 *
	 * Some POSIX systems implement atexit() like Windows, and have each
	 * dynamically loaded module maintain an own atexit chain that is
	 * called when the module is unloaded.
	 *
	 * On other POSIX systems, before a dynamically loaded module is
	 * unloaded, the registered atexit functions (if any) residing in that
	 * module are called, regardless where the code that registered them
	 * resided. This is presumably the most robust approach.
	 *
	 * As can be seen from the above, for portability it's best to avoid
	 * calling g_atexit() (or atexit()) except in the main executable of a
	 * program.
	 *
	 * Deprecated: It is best to avoid g_atexit().
	 *
	 * Params:
	 *     func = the function to call on normal program termination.
