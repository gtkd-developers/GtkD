	/**
	 * Unquotes a string as the shell (/bin/sh) would.
	 *
	 * This function only handles quotes; if a string contains file globs,
	 * arithmetic operators, variables, backticks, redirections, or other
	 * special-to-the-shell features, the result will be different from the
	 * result a real shell would produce (the variables, backticks, etc.
	 * will be passed through literally instead of being expanded).
	 *
	 * This function is guaranteed to succeed if applied to the result of
	 * g_shell_quote(). If it fails, it returns %NULL and sets the
	 * error.
	 *
	 * The @quoted_string need not actually contain quoted or escaped text;
	 * g_shell_unquote() simply goes through the string and unquotes/unescapes
	 * anything that the shell would. Both single and double quotes are
	 * handled, as are escapes including escaped newlines.
	 *
	 * The return value must be freed with g_free().
	 *
	 * Possible errors are in the %G_SHELL_ERROR domain.
	 *
	 * Shell quoting rules are a bit strange. Single quotes preserve the
	 * literal string exactly. escape sequences are not allowed; not even
	 * `\'` - if you want a `'` in the quoted text, you have to do something
	 * like `'foo'\''bar'`. Double quotes allow `$`, ```, `"`, `\`, and
	 * newline to be escaped with backslash. Otherwise double quotes
	 * preserve things literally.
	 *
	 * Params:
	 *     quotedString = shell-quoted string
	 *
	 * Returns: an unquoted string
	 *
	 * Throws: GException on failure.
