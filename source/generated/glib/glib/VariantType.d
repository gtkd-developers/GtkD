/**
 * This section introduces the GVariant type system. It is based, in
 * large part, on the D-Bus type system, with two major changes and
 * some minor lifting of restrictions. The
 * [D-Bus specification](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html),
 * therefore, provides a significant amount of
 * information that is useful when working with GVariant.
 * 
 * The first major change with respect to the D-Bus type system is the
 * introduction of maybe (or "nullable") types.  Any type in GVariant can be
 * converted to a maybe type, in which case, "nothing" (or "null") becomes a
 * valid value.  Maybe types have been added by introducing the
 * character "m" to type strings.
 * 
 * The second major change is that the GVariant type system supports the
 * concept of "indefinite types" -- types that are less specific than
 * the normal types found in D-Bus.  For example, it is possible to speak
 * of "an array of any type" in GVariant, where the D-Bus type system
 * would require you to speak of "an array of integers" or "an array of
 * strings".  Indefinite types have been added by introducing the
 * characters "*", "?" and "r" to type strings.
 * 
 * Finally, all arbitrary restrictions relating to the complexity of
 * types are lifted along with the restriction that dictionary entries
 * may only appear nested inside of arrays.
 * 
 * Just as in D-Bus, GVariant types are described with strings ("type
 * strings").  Subject to the differences mentioned above, these strings
 * are of the same form as those found in D-Bus.  Note, however: D-Bus
 * always works in terms of messages and therefore individual type
 * strings appear nowhere in its interface.  Instead, "signatures"
 * are a concatenation of the strings of the type of each argument in a
 * message.  GVariant deals with single values directly so GVariant type
 * strings always describe the type of exactly one value.  This means
 * that a D-Bus signature string is generally not a valid GVariant type
 * string -- except in the case that it is the signature of a message
 * containing exactly one argument.
 * 
 * An indefinite type is similar in spirit to what may be called an
 * abstract type in other type systems.  No value can exist that has an
 * indefinite type as its type, but values can exist that have types
 * that are subtypes of indefinite types.  That is to say,
 * g_variant_get_type() will never return an indefinite type, but
 * calling g_variant_is_of_type() with an indefinite type may return
 * %TRUE.  For example, you cannot have a value that represents "an
 * array of no particular type", but you can have an "array of integers"
 * which certainly matches the type of "an array of no particular type",
 * since "array of integers" is a subtype of "array of no particular
 * type".
 * 
 * This is similar to how instances of abstract classes may not
 * directly exist in other type systems, but instances of their
 * non-abstract subtypes may.  For example, in GTK, no object that has
 * the type of #GtkBin can exist (since #GtkBin is an abstract class),
 * but a #GtkWindow can certainly be instantiated, and you would say
 * that the #GtkWindow is a #GtkBin (since #GtkWindow is a subclass of
 * #GtkBin).
 * 
 * ## GVariant Type Strings
 * 
 * A GVariant type string can be any of the following:
 * 
 * - any basic type string (listed below)
 * 
 * - "v", "r" or "*"
 * 
 * - one of the characters 'a' or 'm', followed by another type string
 * 
 * - the character '(', followed by a concatenation of zero or more other
 * type strings, followed by the character ')'
 * 
 * - the character '{', followed by a basic type string (see below),
 * followed by another type string, followed by the character '}'
 * 
 * A basic type string describes a basic type (as per
 * g_variant_type_is_basic()) and is always a single character in length.
 * The valid basic type strings are "b", "y", "n", "q", "i", "u", "x", "t",
 * "h", "d", "s", "o", "g" and "?".
 * 
 * The above definition is recursive to arbitrary depth. "aaaaai" and
 * "(ui(nq((y)))s)" are both valid type strings, as is
 * "a(aa(ui)(qna{ya(yd)}))". In order to not hit memory limits, #GVariant
 * imposes a limit on recursion depth of 65 nested containers. This is the
 * limit in the D-Bus specification (64) plus one to allow a #GDBusMessage to
 * be nested in a top-level tuple.
 * 
 * The meaning of each of the characters is as follows:
 * - `b`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_BOOLEAN; a boolean value.
 * - `y`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_BYTE; a byte.
 * - `n`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT16; a signed 16 bit integer.
 * - `q`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT16; an unsigned 16 bit integer.
 * - `i`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT32; a signed 32 bit integer.
 * - `u`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT32; an unsigned 32 bit integer.
 * - `x`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_INT64; a signed 64 bit integer.
 * - `t`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_UINT64; an unsigned 64 bit integer.
 * - `h`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_HANDLE; a signed 32 bit value
 * that, by convention, is used as an index into an array of file
 * descriptors that are sent alongside a D-Bus message.
 * - `d`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_DOUBLE; a double precision
 * floating point value.
 * - `s`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_STRING; a string.
 * - `o`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_OBJECT_PATH; a string in the form
 * of a D-Bus object path.
 * - `g`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_SIGNATURE; a string in the form of
 * a D-Bus type signature.
 * - `?`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_BASIC; an indefinite type that
 * is a supertype of any of the basic types.
 * - `v`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_VARIANT; a container type that
 * contain any other type of value.
 * - `a`: used as a prefix on another type string to mean an array of that
 * type; the type string "ai", for example, is the type of an array of
 * signed 32-bit integers.
 * - `m`: used as a prefix on another type string to mean a "maybe", or
 * "nullable", version of that type; the type string "ms", for example,
 * is the type of a value that maybe contains a string, or maybe contains
 * nothing.
 * - `()`: used to enclose zero or more other concatenated type strings to
 * create a tuple type; the type string "(is)", for example, is the type of
 * a pair of an integer and a string.
 * - `r`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_TUPLE; an indefinite type that is
 * a supertype of any tuple type, regardless of the number of items.
 * - `{}`: used to enclose a basic type string concatenated with another type
 * string to create a dictionary entry type, which usually appears inside of
 * an array to form a dictionary; the type string "a{sd}", for example, is
 * the type of a dictionary that maps strings to double precision floating
 * point values.
 * 
 * The first type (the basic type) is the key type and the second type is
 * the value type. The reason that the first type is restricted to being a
 * basic type is so that it can easily be hashed.
 * - `*`: the type string of %G_VARIANT_TYPE_ANY; the indefinite type that is
 * a supertype of all types.  Note that, as with all type strings, this
 * character represents exactly one type. It cannot be used inside of tuples
 * to mean "any number of items".
 * 
 * Any type string of a container that contains an indefinite type is,
 * itself, an indefinite type. For example, the type string "a*"
 * (corresponding to %G_VARIANT_TYPE_ARRAY) is an indefinite type
 * that is a supertype of every array type. "(*s)" is a supertype
 * of all tuples that contain exactly two items where the second
 * item is a string.
 * 
 * "a{?*}" is an indefinite type that is a supertype of all arrays
 * containing dictionary entries where the key is any basic type and
 * the value is any type at all.  This is, by definition, a dictionary,
 * so this type string corresponds to %G_VARIANT_TYPE_DICTIONARY. Note
 * that, due to the restriction that the key of a dictionary entry must
 * be a basic type, "{**}" is not a valid type string.
