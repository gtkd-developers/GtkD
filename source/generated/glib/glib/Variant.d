/**
 * #GVariant is a variant datatype; it can contain one or more values
 * along with information about the type of the values.
 * 
 * A #GVariant may contain simple types, like an integer, or a boolean value;
 * or complex types, like an array of two strings, or a dictionary of key
 * value pairs. A #GVariant is also immutable: once it's been created neither
 * its type nor its content can be modified further.
 * 
 * GVariant is useful whenever data needs to be serialized, for example when
 * sending method parameters in D-Bus, or when saving settings using GSettings.
 * 
 * When creating a new #GVariant, you pass the data you want to store in it
 * along with a string representing the type of data you wish to pass to it.
 * 
 * For instance, if you want to create a #GVariant holding an integer value you
 * can use:
 * 
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 * GVariant *v = g_variant_new ("u", 40);
 * ]|
 * 
 * The string "u" in the first argument tells #GVariant that the data passed to
 * the constructor (40) is going to be an unsigned integer.
 * 
 * More advanced examples of #GVariant in use can be found in documentation for
 * [GVariant format strings][gvariant-format-strings-pointers].
 * 
 * The range of possible values is determined by the type.
 * 
 * The type system used by #GVariant is #GVariantType.
 * 
 * #GVariant instances always have a type and a value (which are given
 * at construction time).  The type and value of a #GVariant instance
 * can never change other than by the #GVariant itself being
 * destroyed.  A #GVariant cannot contain a pointer.
 * 
 * #GVariant is reference counted using g_variant_ref() and
 * g_variant_unref().  #GVariant also has floating reference counts --
 * see g_variant_ref_sink().
 * 
 * #GVariant is completely threadsafe.  A #GVariant instance can be
 * concurrently accessed in any way from any number of threads without
 * problems.
 * 
 * #GVariant is heavily optimised for dealing with data in serialized
 * form.  It works particularly well with data located in memory-mapped
 * files.  It can perform nearly all deserialization operations in a
 * small constant time, usually touching only a single memory page.
 * Serialized #GVariant data can also be sent over the network.
 * 
 * #GVariant is largely compatible with D-Bus.  Almost all types of
 * #GVariant instances can be sent over D-Bus.  See #GVariantType for
 * exceptions.  (However, #GVariant's serialization format is not the same
 * as the serialization format of a D-Bus message body: use #GDBusMessage,
 * in the gio library, for those.)
 * 
 * For space-efficiency, the #GVariant serialization format does not
 * automatically include the variant's length, type or endianness,
 * which must either be implied from context (such as knowledge that a
 * particular file format always contains a little-endian
 * %G_VARIANT_TYPE_VARIANT which occupies the whole length of the file)
 * or supplied out-of-band (for instance, a length, type and/or endianness
 * indicator could be placed at the beginning of a file, network message
 * or network stream).
 * 
 * A #GVariant's size is limited mainly by any lower level operating
 * system constraints, such as the number of bits in #gsize.  For
 * example, it is reasonable to have a 2GB file mapped into memory
 * with #GMappedFile, and call g_variant_new_from_data() on it.
 * 
 * For convenience to C programmers, #GVariant features powerful
 * varargs-based value construction and destruction.  This feature is
 * designed to be embedded in other libraries.
 * 
 * There is a Python-inspired text language for describing #GVariant
 * values.  #GVariant includes a printer for this language and a parser
 * with type inferencing.
 * 
 * ## Memory Use
 * 
 * #GVariant tries to be quite efficient with respect to memory use.
 * This section gives a rough idea of how much memory is used by the
 * current implementation.  The information here is subject to change
 * in the future.
 * 
 * The memory allocated by #GVariant can be grouped into 4 broad
 * purposes: memory for serialized data, memory for the type
 * information cache, buffer management memory and memory for the
 * #GVariant structure itself.
 * 
 * ## Serialized Data Memory
 * 
 * This is the memory that is used for storing GVariant data in
 * serialized form.  This is what would be sent over the network or
 * what would end up on disk, not counting any indicator of the
 * endianness, or of the length or type of the top-level variant.
 * 
 * The amount of memory required to store a boolean is 1 byte. 16,
 * 32 and 64 bit integers and double precision floating point numbers
 * use their "natural" size.  Strings (including object path and
 * signature strings) are stored with a nul terminator, and as such
 * use the length of the string plus 1 byte.
 * 
 * Maybe types use no space at all to represent the null value and
 * use the same amount of space (sometimes plus one byte) as the
 * equivalent non-maybe-typed value to represent the non-null case.
 * 
 * Arrays use the amount of space required to store each of their
 * members, concatenated.  Additionally, if the items stored in an
 * array are not of a fixed-size (ie: strings, other arrays, etc)
 * then an additional framing offset is stored for each item.  The
 * size of this offset is either 1, 2 or 4 bytes depending on the
 * overall size of the container.  Additionally, extra padding bytes
 * are added as required for alignment of child values.
 * 
 * Tuples (including dictionary entries) use the amount of space
 * required to store each of their members, concatenated, plus one
 * framing offset (as per arrays) for each non-fixed-sized item in
 * the tuple, except for the last one.  Additionally, extra padding
 * bytes are added as required for alignment of child values.
 * 
 * Variants use the same amount of space as the item inside of the
 * variant, plus 1 byte, plus the length of the type string for the
 * item inside the variant.
 * 
 * As an example, consider a dictionary mapping strings to variants.
 * In the case that the dictionary is empty, 0 bytes are required for
 * the serialization.
 * 
 * If we add an item "width" that maps to the int32 value of 500 then
 * we will use 4 byte to store the int32 (so 6 for the variant
 * containing it) and 6 bytes for the string.  The variant must be
 * aligned to 8 after the 6 bytes of the string, so that's 2 extra
 * bytes.  6 (string) + 2 (padding) + 6 (variant) is 14 bytes used
 * for the dictionary entry.  An additional 1 byte is added to the
 * array as a framing offset making a total of 15 bytes.
 * 
 * If we add another entry, "title" that maps to a nullable string
 * that happens to have a value of null, then we use 0 bytes for the
 * null value (and 3 bytes for the variant to contain it along with
 * its type string) plus 6 bytes for the string.  Again, we need 2
 * padding bytes.  That makes a total of 6 + 2 + 3 = 11 bytes.
 * 
 * We now require extra padding between the two items in the array.
 * After the 14 bytes of the first item, that's 2 bytes required.
 * We now require 2 framing offsets for an extra two
 * bytes. 14 + 2 + 11 + 2 = 29 bytes to encode the entire two-item
 * dictionary.
 * 
 * ## Type Information Cache
 * 
 * For each GVariant type that currently exists in the program a type
 * information structure is kept in the type information cache.  The
 * type information structure is required for rapid deserialization.
 * 
 * Continuing with the above example, if a #GVariant exists with the
 * type "a{sv}" then a type information struct will exist for
 * "a{sv}", "{sv}", "s", and "v".  Multiple uses of the same type
 * will share the same type information.  Additionally, all
 * single-digit types are stored in read-only static memory and do
 * not contribute to the writable memory footprint of a program using
 * #GVariant.
 * 
 * Aside from the type information structures stored in read-only
 * memory, there are two forms of type information.  One is used for
 * container types where there is a single element type: arrays and
 * maybe types.  The other is used for container types where there
 * are multiple element types: tuples and dictionary entries.
 * 
 * Array type info structures are 6 * sizeof (void *), plus the
 * memory required to store the type string itself.  This means that
 * on 32-bit systems, the cache entry for "a{sv}" would require 30
 * bytes of memory (plus malloc overhead).
 * 
 * Tuple type info structures are 6 * sizeof (void *), plus 4 *
 * sizeof (void *) for each item in the tuple, plus the memory
 * required to store the type string itself.  A 2-item tuple, for
 * example, would have a type information structure that consumed
 * writable memory in the size of 14 * sizeof (void *) (plus type
 * string)  This means that on 32-bit systems, the cache entry for
 * "{sv}" would require 61 bytes of memory (plus malloc overhead).
 * 
 * This means that in total, for our "a{sv}" example, 91 bytes of
 * type information would be allocated.
 * 
 * The type information cache, additionally, uses a #GHashTable to
 * store and look up the cached items and stores a pointer to this
 * hash table in static storage.  The hash table is freed when there
 * are zero items in the type cache.
 * 
 * Although these sizes may seem large it is important to remember
 * that a program will probably only have a very small number of
 * different types of values in it and that only one type information
 * structure is required for many different values of the same type.
 * 
 * ## Buffer Management Memory
 * 
 * #GVariant uses an internal buffer management structure to deal
 * with the various different possible sources of serialized data
 * that it uses.  The buffer is responsible for ensuring that the
 * correct call is made when the data is no longer in use by
 * #GVariant.  This may involve a g_free() or a g_slice_free() or
 * even g_mapped_file_unref().
 * 
 * One buffer management structure is used for each chunk of
 * serialized data.  The size of the buffer management structure
 * is 4 * (void *).  On 32-bit systems, that's 16 bytes.
 * 
 * ## GVariant structure
 * 
 * The size of a #GVariant structure is 6 * (void *).  On 32-bit
 * systems, that's 24 bytes.
 * 
 * #GVariant structures only exist if they are explicitly created
 * with API calls.  For example, if a #GVariant is constructed out of
 * serialized data for the example given above (with the dictionary)
 * then although there are 9 individual values that comprise the
 * entire dictionary (two keys, two values, two variants containing
 * the values, two dictionary entries, plus the dictionary itself),
 * only 1 #GVariant instance exists -- the one referring to the
 * dictionary.
 * 
 * If calls are made to start accessing the other values then
 * #GVariant instances will exist for those values only for as long
 * as they are in use (ie: until you call g_variant_unref()).  The
 * type information is shared.  The serialized data and the buffer
 * management structure for that serialized data is shared by the
 * child.
 * 
 * ## Summary
 * 
 * To put the entire example together, for our dictionary mapping
 * strings to variants (with two entries, as given above), we are
 * using 91 bytes of memory for type information, 29 bytes of memory
 * for the serialized data, 16 bytes for buffer management and 24
 * bytes for the #GVariant instance, or a total of 160 bytes, plus
 * malloc overhead.  If we were to use g_variant_get_child_value() to
 * access the two dictionary entries, we would use an additional 48
 * bytes.  If we were to have other dictionaries of the same type, we
 * would use more memory for the serialized data and buffer
 * management for those dictionaries, but the type information would
 * be shared.

	 * non-floating references, but there is one specific scenario where
	 * this function is helpful.
	 *
	 * The situation where this function is helpful is when creating an API
	 * that allows the user to provide a callback function that returns a
	 * #GVariant.  We certainly want to allow the user the flexibility to
	 * return a non-floating reference from this callback (for the case
	 * where the value that is being returned already exists).
	 *
	 * At the same time, the style of the #GVariant API makes it likely that
	 * for newly-created #GVariant instances, the user can be saved some
	 * typing if they are allowed to return a #GVariant with a floating
	 * reference.
	 *
	 * Using this function on the return value of the user's callback allows
	 * the user to do whichever is more convenient for them.  The caller
	 * will always receives exactly one full reference to the value: either
	 * the one that was returned in the first place, or a floating reference
	 * that has been converted to a full reference.
	 *
	 * This function has an odd interaction when combined with
	 * g_variant_ref_sink() running at the same time in another thread on
	 * the same #GVariant instance.  If g_variant_ref_sink() runs first then
	 * the result will be that the floating reference is converted to a hard
	 * reference.  If g_variant_take_ref() runs first then the result will
	 * be that the floating reference is converted to a hard reference and
	 * an additional reference on top of that one is added.  It is best to
