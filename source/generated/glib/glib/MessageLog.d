	 * The default log handler set up by GLib; g_log_set_default_handler()

	 * This is used if no log handler has been set for the particular log
	 * domain and log level combination. It outputs the message to stderr
	 * or stdout and if the log level is fatal it calls G_BREAKPOINT(). It automatically
	 * prints a new-line character after the message, so one does not need to be
	 * manually included in @message.
	 *
	 * The behavior of this log handler can be influenced by a number of
	 * environment variables:
	 *
	 * - `G_MESSAGES_PREFIXED`: A :-separated list of log levels for which
	 * messages should be prefixed by the program name and PID of the
	 * application.
	 *
	 * - `G_MESSAGES_DEBUG`: A space-separated list of log domains for
	 * which debug and informational messages are printed. By default
	 * these messages are not printed.
	 *
	 * stderr is used for levels %G_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR, %G_LOG_LEVEL_CRITICAL,
	 * %G_LOG_LEVEL_WARNING and %G_LOG_LEVEL_MESSAGE. stdout is used for
	 * the rest, unless stderr was requested by
	 * g_log_writer_default_set_use_stderr().
