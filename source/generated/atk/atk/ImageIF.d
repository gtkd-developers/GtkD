/**
 * #AtkImage should be implemented by #AtkObject subtypes on behalf of
 * components which display image/pixmap information onscreen, and
 * which provide information (other than just widget borders, etc.)
 * via that image content.  For instance, icons, buttons with icons,
 * toolbar elements, and image viewing panes typically should
 * implement #AtkImage.
 * 
 * #AtkImage primarily provides two types of information: coordinate
 * information (useful for screen review mode of screenreaders, and
 * for use by onscreen magnifiers), and descriptive information.  The
 * descriptive information is provided for alternative, text-only
 * presentation of the most significant information present in the
 * image.
