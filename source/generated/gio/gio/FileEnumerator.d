/**
 * #GFileEnumerator allows you to operate on a set of #GFiles,
 * returning a #GFileInfo structure for each file enumerated (e.g.
 * g_file_enumerate_children() will return a #GFileEnumerator for each
 * of the children within a directory).
 * 
 * To get the next file's information from a #GFileEnumerator, use
 * g_file_enumerator_next_file() or its asynchronous version,
 * g_file_enumerator_next_files_async(). Note that the asynchronous
 * version will return a list of #GFileInfos, whereas the
 * synchronous will only return the next file in the enumerator.
 * 
 * The ordering of returned files is unspecified for non-Unix
 * platforms; for more information, see g_dir_read_name().  On Unix,
 * when operating on local files, returned files will be sorted by
 * inode number.  Effectively you can assume that the ordering of
 * returned files will be stable between successive calls (and
 * applications) assuming the directory is unchanged.
 * 
 * If your application needs a specific ordering, such as by name or
 * modification time, you will have to implement that in your
 * application code.
 * 
 * To close a #GFileEnumerator, use g_file_enumerator_close(), or
 * its asynchronous version, g_file_enumerator_close_async(). Once
 * a #GFileEnumerator is closed, no further actions may be performed
 * on it, and it should be freed with g_object_unref().

	 * This is a version of g_file_enumerator_next_file() that's easier to
	 * use correctly from C programs.  With g_file_enumerator_next_file(),
	 * the gboolean return value signifies "end of iteration or error", which
	 * requires allocation of a temporary #GError.
	 *
	 * In contrast, with this function, a %FALSE return from
	 * g_file_enumerator_iterate() *always* means
	 * "error".  End of iteration is signaled by @out_info or @out_child being %NULL.
	 *
	 * Another crucial difference is that the references for @out_info and
	 * @out_child are owned by @direnum (they are cached as hidden
	 * properties).  You must not unref them in your own code.  This makes
	 * memory management significantly easier for C code in combination
	 * with loops.
	 *
	 * Finally, this function optionally allows retrieving a #GFile as
	 * well.
	 *
	 * You must specify at least one of @out_info or @out_child.
	 *
	 * The code pattern for correctly using g_file_enumerator_iterate() from C
	 * is:
	 *
	 * |[
	 * direnum = g_file_enumerate_children (file, ...);
	 * while (TRUE)

	 * if (!g_file_enumerator_iterate (direnum, &info, NULL, cancellable, error))
	 * goto out;
	 * if (!info)
	 * break;
	 * ... do stuff with "info"; do not unref it! ...
	 * }
	 *
	 * out:
	 * g_object_unref (direnum); // Note: frees the last @info
	 * ]|
	 *
	 * Params:
	 *     outInfo = Output location for the next #GFileInfo, or %NULL
	 *     outChild = Output location for the next #GFile, or %NULL
	 *     cancellable = a #GCancellable
	 *
