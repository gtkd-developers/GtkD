/**
 * #GDtlsConnection is the base DTLS connection class type, which wraps
 * a #GDatagramBased and provides DTLS encryption on top of it. Its
 * subclasses, #GDtlsClientConnection and #GDtlsServerConnection,
 * implement client-side and server-side DTLS, respectively.
 * 
 * For TLS support, see #GTlsConnection.
 * 
 * As DTLS is datagram based, #GDtlsConnection implements #GDatagramBased,
 * presenting a datagram-socket-like API for the encrypted connection. This
 * operates over a base datagram connection, which is also a #GDatagramBased
 * (#GDtlsConnection:base-socket).
 * 
 * To close a DTLS connection, use g_dtls_connection_close().
 * 
 * Neither #GDtlsServerConnection or #GDtlsClientConnection set the peer address
 * on their base #GDatagramBased if it is a #GSocket â€” it is up to the caller to
 * do that if they wish. If they do not, and g_socket_close() is called on the
 * base socket, the #GDtlsConnection will not raise a %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_CONNECTED
 * error on further I/O.

	/**
	 * Emitted during the TLS handshake after the peer certificate has
	 * been received. You can examine @peer_cert's certification path by
	 * calling g_tls_certificate_get_issuer() on it.
	 *
	 * For a client-side connection, @peer_cert is the server's
	 * certificate, and the signal will only be emitted if the
	 * certificate was not acceptable according to @conn's
	 * #GDtlsClientConnection:validation_flags. If you would like the
	 * certificate to be accepted despite @errors, return %TRUE from the
	 * signal handler. Otherwise, if no handler accepts the certificate,
	 * the handshake will fail with %G_TLS_ERROR_BAD_CERTIFICATE.
	 *
	 * GLib guarantees that if certificate verification fails, this signal
	 * will be emitted with at least one error will be set in @errors, but
	 * it does not guarantee that all possible errors will be set.
	 * Accordingly, you may not safely decide to ignore any particular
	 * type of error. For example, it would be incorrect to ignore
	 * %G_TLS_CERTIFICATE_EXPIRED if you want to allow expired
	 * certificates, because this could potentially be the only error flag
	 * set even if other problems exist with the certificate.
	 *
	 * For a server-side connection, @peer_cert is the certificate
	 * presented by the client, if this was requested via the server's
	 * #GDtlsServerConnection:authentication_mode. On the server side,
	 * the signal is always emitted when the client presents a
	 * certificate, and the certificate will only be accepted if a
	 * handler returns %TRUE.
	 *
	 * Note that if this signal is emitted as part of asynchronous I/O
	 * in the main thread, then you should not attempt to interact with
	 * the user before returning from the signal handler. If you want to
	 * let the user decide whether or not to accept the certificate, you
	 * would have to return %FALSE from the signal handler on the first
	 * attempt, and then after the connection attempt returns a
	 * %G_TLS_ERROR_BAD_CERTIFICATE, you can interact with the user, and
	 * if the user decides to accept the certificate, remember that fact,
	 * create a new connection, and return %TRUE from the signal handler
	 * the next time.
	 *
	 * If you are doing I/O in another thread, you do not
	 * need to worry about this, and can simply block in the signal
	 * handler until the UI thread returns an answer.
	 *
	 * Params:
	 *     peerCert = the peer's #GTlsCertificate
	 *     errors = the problems with @peer_cert.
	 *
	 * Returns: %TRUE to accept @peer_cert (which will also
	 *     immediately end the signal emission). %FALSE to allow the signal
	 *     emission to continue, which will cause the handshake to fail if
	 *     no one else overrides it.
