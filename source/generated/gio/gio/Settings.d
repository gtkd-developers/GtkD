/**
 * The #GSettings class provides a convenient API for storing and retrieving
 * application settings.
 * 
 * Reads and writes can be considered to be non-blocking.  Reading
 * settings with #GSettings is typically extremely fast: on
 * approximately the same order of magnitude (but slower than) a
 * #GHashTable lookup.  Writing settings is also extremely fast in terms
 * of time to return to your application, but can be extremely expensive
 * for other threads and other processes.  Many settings backends
 * (including dconf) have lazy initialisation which means in the common
 * case of the user using their computer without modifying any settings
 * a lot of work can be avoided.  For dconf, the D-Bus service doesn't
 * even need to be started in this case.  For this reason, you should
 * only ever modify #GSettings keys in response to explicit user action.
 * Particular care should be paid to ensure that modifications are not
 * made during startup -- for example, when setting the initial value
 * of preferences widgets.  The built-in g_settings_bind() functionality
 * is careful not to write settings in response to notify signals as a
 * result of modifications that it makes to widgets.
 * 
 * When creating a GSettings instance, you have to specify a schema
 * that describes the keys in your settings and their types and default
 * values, as well as some other information.
 * 
 * Normally, a schema has a fixed path that determines where the settings
 * are stored in the conceptual global tree of settings. However, schemas
 * can also be '[relocatable][gsettings-relocatable]', i.e. not equipped with
 * a fixed path. This is
 * useful e.g. when the schema describes an 'account', and you want to be
 * able to store a arbitrary number of accounts.
 * 
 * Paths must start with and end with a forward slash character ('/')
 * and must not contain two sequential slash characters.  Paths should
 * be chosen based on a domain name associated with the program or
 * library to which the settings belong.  Examples of paths are
 * "/org/gtk/settings/file-chooser/" and "/ca/desrt/dconf-editor/".
 * Paths should not start with "/apps/", "/desktop/" or "/system/" as
 * they often did in GConf.
 * 
 * Unlike other configuration systems (like GConf), GSettings does not
 * restrict keys to basic types like strings and numbers. GSettings stores
 * values as #GVariant, and allows any #GVariantType for keys. Key names
 * are restricted to lowercase characters, numbers and '-'. Furthermore,
 * the names must begin with a lowercase character, must not end
 * with a '-', and must not contain consecutive dashes.
 * 
 * Similar to GConf, the default values in GSettings schemas can be
 * localized, but the localized values are stored in gettext catalogs
 * and looked up with the domain that is specified in the
 * `gettext-domain` attribute of the <schemalist> or <schema>
 * elements and the category that is specified in the `l10n` attribute of
 * the <default> element. The string which is translated includes all text in
 * the <default> element, including any surrounding quotation marks.
 * 
 * The `l10n` attribute must be set to `messages` or `time`, and sets the
 * [locale category for
 * translation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Aspects.html#index-locale-categories-1).
 * The `messages` category should be used by default; use `time` for
 * translatable date or time formats. A translation comment can be added as an
 * XML comment immediately above the <default> element â€” it is recommended to
 * add these comments to aid translators understand the meaning and
 * implications of the default value. An optional translation `context`
 * attribute can be set on the <default> element to disambiguate multiple
 * defaults which use the same string.
 * 
 * For example:
 * |[
 * <!-- Translators: A list of words which are not allowed to be typed, in
 * GVariant serialization syntax.
 * See: https://developer.gnome.org/glib/stable/gvariant-text.html -->
 * <default l10n='messages' context='Banned words'>['bad', 'words']</default>
 * ]|
 * 
 * Translations of default values must remain syntactically valid serialized
 * #GVariants (e.g. retaining any surrounding quotation marks) or runtime
 * errors will occur.
 * 
 * GSettings uses schemas in a compact binary form that is created
 * by the [glib-compile-schemas][glib-compile-schemas]
 * utility. The input is a schema description in an XML format.
 * 
 * A DTD for the gschema XML format can be found here:
 * [gschema.dtd](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/blob/HEAD/gio/gschema.dtd)
 * 
 * The [glib-compile-schemas][glib-compile-schemas] tool expects schema
 * files to have the extension `.gschema.xml`.
 * 
 * At runtime, schemas are identified by their id (as specified in the
 * id attribute of the <schema> element). The convention for schema
 * ids is to use a dotted name, similar in style to a D-Bus bus name,
 * e.g. "org.gnome.SessionManager". In particular, if the settings are
 * for a specific service that owns a D-Bus bus name, the D-Bus bus name
 * and schema id should match. For schemas which deal with settings not
 * associated with one named application, the id should not use
 * StudlyCaps, e.g. "org.gnome.font-rendering".
 * 
 * In addition to #GVariant types, keys can have types that have
 * enumerated types. These can be described by a <choice>,
 * <enum> or <flags> element, as seen in the
 * [example][schema-enumerated]. The underlying type of such a key
 * is string, but you can use g_settings_get_enum(), g_settings_set_enum(),
 * g_settings_get_flags(), g_settings_set_flags() access the numeric values
 * corresponding to the string value of enum and flags keys.
 * 
 * An example for default value:
 * |[
 * <schemalist>
 * <schema id="org.gtk.Test" path="/org/gtk/Test/" gettext-domain="test">
 * 
 * <key name="greeting" type="s">
 * <default l10n="messages">"Hello, earthlings"</default>
 * <summary>A greeting</summary>
 * <description>
 * Greeting of the invading martians
 * </description>
 * </key>
 * 
 * <key name="box" type="(ii)">
 * <default>(20,30)</default>
 * </key>
 * 
 * <key name="empty-string" type="s">
 * <default>""</default>
 * <summary>Empty strings have to be provided in GVariant form</summary>
 * </key>
 * 
 * </schema>
 * </schemalist>
 * ]|
 * 
 * An example for ranges, choices and enumerated types:
 * |[
 * <schemalist>
 * 
 * <enum id="org.gtk.Test.myenum">
 * <value nick="first" value="1"/>
 * <value nick="second" value="2"/>
 * </enum>
 * 
 * <flags id="org.gtk.Test.myflags">
 * <value nick="flag1" value="1"/>
 * <value nick="flag2" value="2"/>
 * <value nick="flag3" value="4"/>
 * </flags>
 * 
 * <schema id="org.gtk.Test">
 * 
 * <key name="key-with-range" type="i">
 * <range min="1" max="100"/>
 * <default>10</default>
 * </key>
 * 
 * <key name="key-with-choices" type="s">
 * <choices>
 * <choice value='Elisabeth'/>
 * <choice value='Annabeth'/>
 * <choice value='Joe'/>
 * </choices>
 * <aliases>
 * <alias value='Anna' target='Annabeth'/>
 * <alias value='Beth' target='Elisabeth'/>
 * </aliases>
 * <default>'Joe'</default>
 * </key>
 * 
 * <key name='enumerated-key' enum='org.gtk.Test.myenum'>
 * <default>'first'</default>
 * </key>
 * 
 * <key name='flags-key' flags='org.gtk.Test.myflags'>
 * <default>["flag1","flag2"]</default>
 * </key>
 * </schema>
 * </schemalist>
 * ]|
 * 
 * ## Vendor overrides
 * 
 * Default values are defined in the schemas that get installed by
 * an application. Sometimes, it is necessary for a vendor or distributor
 * to adjust these defaults. Since patching the XML source for the schema
 * is inconvenient and error-prone,
 * [glib-compile-schemas][glib-compile-schemas] reads so-called vendor
 * override' files. These are keyfiles in the same directory as the XML
 * schema sources which can override default values. The schema id serves
 * as the group name in the key file, and the values are expected in
 * serialized GVariant form, as in the following example:
 * |[
 * [org.gtk.Example]
 * key1='string'
 * key2=1.5
 * ]|
 * 
 * glib-compile-schemas expects schema files to have the extension
 * `.gschema.override`.
 * 
 * ## Binding
 * 
 * A very convenient feature of GSettings lets you bind #GObject properties
 * directly to settings, using g_settings_bind(). Once a GObject property
 * has been bound to a setting, changes on either side are automatically
 * propagated to the other side. GSettings handles details like mapping
 * between GObject and GVariant types, and preventing infinite cycles.
 * 
 * This makes it very easy to hook up a preferences dialog to the
 * underlying settings. To make this even more convenient, GSettings
 * looks for a boolean property with the name "sensitivity" and
 * automatically binds it to the writability of the bound setting.
 * If this 'magic' gets in the way, it can be suppressed with the
 * %G_SETTINGS_BIND_NO_SENSITIVITY flag.
 * 
 * ## Relocatable schemas # {#gsettings-relocatable}
 * 
 * A relocatable schema is one with no `path` attribute specified on its
 * <schema> element. By using g_settings_new_with_path(), a #GSettings object
 * can be instantiated for a relocatable schema, assigning a path to the
 * instance. Paths passed to g_settings_new_with_path() will typically be
 * constructed dynamically from a constant prefix plus some form of instance
 * identifier; but they must still be valid GSettings paths. Paths could also
 * be constant and used with a globally installed schema originating from a
 * dependency library.
 * 
 * For example, a relocatable schema could be used to store geometry information
 * for different windows in an application. If the schema ID was
 * `org.foo.MyApp.Window`, it could be instantiated for paths
 * `/org/foo/MyApp/main/`, `/org/foo/MyApp/document-1/`,
 * `/org/foo/MyApp/document-2/`, etc. If any of the paths are well-known
 * they can be specified as <child> elements in the parent schema, e.g.:
 * |[
 * <schema id="org.foo.MyApp" path="/org/foo/MyApp/">
 * <child name="main" schema="org.foo.MyApp.Window"/>
 * </schema>
 * ]|
 * 
 * ## Build system integration # {#gsettings-build-system}
 * 
 * GSettings comes with autotools integration to simplify compiling and
 * installing schemas. To add GSettings support to an application, add the
 * following to your `configure.ac`:
 * |[
 * GLIB_GSETTINGS
 * ]|
 * 
 * In the appropriate `Makefile.am`, use the following snippet to compile and
 * install the named schema:
 * |[
 * gsettings_SCHEMAS = org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
 * EXTRA_DIST = $(gsettings_SCHEMAS)
 * 
 * @GSETTINGS_RULES@
 * ]|
 * 
 * No changes are needed to the build system to mark a schema XML file for
 * translation. Assuming it sets the `gettext-domain` attribute, a schema may
 * be marked for translation by adding it to `POTFILES.in`, assuming gettext
 * 0.19 is in use (the preferred method for translation):
 * |[
 * data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
 * ]|
 * 
 * Alternatively, if intltool 0.50.1 is in use:
 * |[
 * [type: gettext/gsettings]data/org.foo.MyApp.gschema.xml
 * ]|
 * 
 * GSettings will use gettext to look up translations for the <summary> and
 * <description> elements, and also any <default> elements which have a `l10n`
 * attribute set. Translations must not be included in the `.gschema.xml` file
 * by the build system, for example by using intltool XML rules with a
 * `.gschema.xml.in` template.
 * 
 * If an enumerated type defined in a C header file is to be used in a GSettings
 * schema, it can either be defined manually using an <enum> element in the
 * schema XML, or it can be extracted automatically from the C header. This
 * approach is preferred, as it ensures the two representations are always
 * synchronised. To do so, add the following to the relevant `Makefile.am`:
 * |[
 * gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE = org.foo.MyApp
 * gsettings_ENUM_FILES = my-app-enums.h my-app-misc.h
 * ]|
 * 
 * `gsettings_ENUM_NAMESPACE` specifies the schema namespace for the enum files,
 * which are specified in `gsettings_ENUM_FILES`. This will generate a
 * `org.foo.MyApp.enums.xml` file containing the extracted enums, which will be
 * automatically included in the schema compilation, install and uninstall
 * rules. It should not be committed to version control or included in
 * `EXTRA_DIST`.
