/**
 * A #GSocket is a low-level networking primitive. It is a more or less
 * direct mapping of the BSD socket API in a portable GObject based API.
 * It supports both the UNIX socket implementations and winsock2 on Windows.
 * 
 * #GSocket is the platform independent base upon which the higher level
 * network primitives are based. Applications are not typically meant to
 * use it directly, but rather through classes like #GSocketClient,
 * #GSocketService and #GSocketConnection. However there may be cases where
 * direct use of #GSocket is useful.
 * 
 * #GSocket implements the #GInitable interface, so if it is manually constructed
 * by e.g. g_object_new() you must call g_initable_init() and check the
 * results before using the object. This is done automatically in
 * g_socket_new() and g_socket_new_from_fd(), so these functions can return
 * %NULL.
 * 
 * Sockets operate in two general modes, blocking or non-blocking. When
 * in blocking mode all operations (which donâ€™t take an explicit blocking
 * parameter) block until the requested operation
 * is finished or there is an error. In non-blocking mode all calls that
 * would block return immediately with a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error.
 * To know when a call would successfully run you can call g_socket_condition_check(),
 * or g_socket_condition_wait(). You can also use g_socket_create_source() and
 * attach it to a #GMainContext to get callbacks when I/O is possible.
 * Note that all sockets are always set to non blocking mode in the system, and
 * blocking mode is emulated in GSocket.
 * 
 * When working in non-blocking mode applications should always be able to
 * handle getting a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error even when some other
 * function said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case
 * of a race condition in the application, but it can also happen for other
 * reasons. For instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable
 * until a write returns %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK.
 * 
 * #GSockets can be either connection oriented or datagram based.
 * For connection oriented types you must first establish a connection by
 * either connecting to an address or accepting a connection from another
 * address. For connectionless socket types the target/source address is
 * specified or received in each I/O operation.
 * 
 * All socket file descriptors are set to be close-on-exec.
 * 
 * Note that creating a #GSocket causes the signal %SIGPIPE to be
 * ignored for the remainder of the program. If you are writing a
 * command-line utility that uses #GSocket, you may need to take into
 * account the fact that your program will not automatically be killed
 * if it tries to write to %stdout after it has been closed.
 * 
 * Like most other APIs in GLib, #GSocket is not inherently thread safe. To use
 * a #GSocket concurrently from multiple threads, you must implement your own
 * locking.
 *
 * Since: 2.22
