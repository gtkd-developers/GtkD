/**
 * A #GDatagramBased is a networking interface for representing datagram-based
 * communications. It is a more or less direct mapping of the core parts of the
 * BSD socket API in a portable GObject interface. It is implemented by
 * #GSocket, which wraps the UNIX socket API on UNIX and winsock2 on Windows.
 * 
 * #GDatagramBased is entirely platform independent, and is intended to be used
 * alongside higher-level networking APIs such as #GIOStream.
 * 
 * It uses vectored scatter/gather I/O by default, allowing for many messages
 * to be sent or received in a single call. Where possible, implementations of
 * the interface should take advantage of vectored I/O to minimise processing
 * or system calls. For example, #GSocket uses recvmmsg() and sendmmsg() where
 * possible. Callers should take advantage of scatter/gather I/O (the use of
 * multiple buffers per message) to avoid unnecessary copying of data to
 * assemble or disassemble a message.
 * 
 * Each #GDatagramBased operation has a timeout parameter which may be negative
 * for blocking behaviour, zero for non-blocking behaviour, or positive for
 * timeout behaviour. A blocking operation blocks until finished or there is an
 * error. A non-blocking operation will return immediately with a
 * %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error if it cannot make progress. A timeout operation
 * will block until the operation is complete or the timeout expires; if the
 * timeout expires it will return what progress it made, or
 * %G_IO_ERROR_TIMED_OUT if no progress was made. To know when a call would
 * successfully run you can call g_datagram_based_condition_check() or
 * g_datagram_based_condition_wait(). You can also use
 * g_datagram_based_create_source() and attach it to a #GMainContext to get
 * callbacks when I/O is possible.
 * 
 * When running a non-blocking operation applications should always be able to
 * handle getting a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error even when some other function
 * said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case of a race
 * condition in the application, but it can also happen for other reasons. For
 * instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable until a write
 * returns %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK.
 * 
 * As with #GSocket, #GDatagramBaseds can be either connection oriented (for
 * example, SCTP) or connectionless (for example, UDP). #GDatagramBaseds must be
 * datagram-based, not stream-based. The interface does not cover connection
 * establishment — use methods on the underlying type to establish a connection
 * before sending and receiving data through the #GDatagramBased API. For
 * connectionless socket types the target/source address is specified or
 * received in each I/O operation.
 * 
 * Like most other APIs in GLib, #GDatagramBased is not inherently thread safe.
 * To use a #GDatagramBased concurrently from multiple threads, you must
 * implement your own locking.
 *
 * Since: 2.48

	 * Checks on the readiness of @datagram_based to perform operations. The

	 * currently-satisfied conditions on @datagram_based. The result is returned.
	 *
	 * %G_IO_IN will be set in the return value if data is available to read with
	 * g_datagram_based_receive_messages(), or if the connection is closed remotely
	 * (EOS); and if the datagram_based has not been closed locally using some

	 *
	 * %G_IO_OUT will be set if it is expected that at least one byte can be sent
	 * using g_datagram_based_send_messages() without blocking. It will not be set
	 * if the datagram_based has been closed locally.
	 *
	 * %G_IO_HUP will be set if the connection has been closed locally.
	 *
	 * %G_IO_ERR will be set if there was an asynchronous error in transmitting data
	 * previously enqueued using g_datagram_based_send_messages().
	 *
	 * Note that on Windows, it is possible for an operation to return
	 * %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK even immediately after
	 * g_datagram_based_condition_check() has claimed that the #GDatagramBased is
	 * ready for writing. Rather than calling g_datagram_based_condition_check() and

	 * simply try writing right away, and try again later if the initial attempt
