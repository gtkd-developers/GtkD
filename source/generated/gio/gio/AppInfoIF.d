/**
 * #GAppInfo and #GAppLaunchContext are used for describing and launching
 * applications installed on the system.
 * 
 * As of GLib 2.20, URIs will always be converted to POSIX paths
 * (using g_file_get_path()) when using g_app_info_launch() even if
 * the application requested an URI and not a POSIX path. For example
 * for a desktop-file based application with Exec key `totem
 * %U` and a single URI, `sftp://foo/file.avi`, then
 * `/home/user/.gvfs/sftp on foo/file.avi` will be passed. This will
 * only work if a set of suitable GIO extensions (such as gvfs 2.26
 * compiled with FUSE support), is available and operational; if this
 * is not the case, the URI will be passed unmodified to the application.
 * Some URIs, such as `mailto:`, of course cannot be mapped to a POSIX
 * path (in gvfs there's no FUSE mount for it); such URIs will be
 * passed unmodified to the application.
 * 
 * Specifically for gvfs 2.26 and later, the POSIX URI will be mapped
 * back to the GIO URI in the #GFile constructors (since gvfs
 * implements the #GVfs extension point). As such, if the application
 * needs to examine the URI, it needs to use g_file_get_uri() or
 * similar on #GFile. In other words, an application cannot assume
 * that the URI passed to e.g. g_file_new_for_commandline_arg() is
 * equal to the result of g_file_get_uri(). The following snippet
 * illustrates this:
 * 
 * |[
 * GFile *f;
 * char *uri;
 * 
 * file = g_file_new_for_commandline_arg (uri_from_commandline);
 * 
 * uri = g_file_get_uri (file);
 * strcmp (uri, uri_from_commandline) == 0;
 * g_free (uri);
 * 
 * if (g_file_has_uri_scheme (file, "cdda"))
 * {
 * // do something special with uri
 * }
 * g_object_unref (file);
 * ]|
 * 
 * This code will work when both `cdda://sr0/Track 1.wav` and
 * `/home/user/.gvfs/cdda on sr0/Track 1.wav` is passed to the
 * application. It should be noted that it's generally not safe
 * for applications to rely on the format of a particular URIs.
 * Different launcher applications (e.g. file managers) may have
 * different ideas of what a given URI means.
