/**
 * #GInitable is implemented by objects that can fail during
 * initialization. If an object implements this interface then
 * it must be initialized as the first thing after construction,
 * either via g_initable_init() or g_async_initable_init_async()
 * (the latter is only available if it also implements #GAsyncInitable).
 * 
 * If the object is not initialized, or initialization returns with an
 * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and
 * g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and have undefined
 * behaviour. They will often fail with g_critical() or g_warning(), but
 * this must not be relied on.
 * 
 * Users of objects implementing this are not intended to use
 * the interface method directly, instead it will be used automatically
 * in various ways. For C applications you generally just call
 * g_initable_new() directly, or indirectly via a foo_thing_new() wrapper.
 * This will call g_initable_init() under the cover, returning %NULL and
 * setting a #GError on failure (at which point the instance is
 * unreferenced).
 * 
 * For bindings in languages where the native constructor supports
 * exceptions the binding could check for objects implementing %GInitable
 * during normal construction and automatically initialize them, throwing
 * an exception on failure.
 *
 * Since: 2.22

	 * Initializes the object implementing the interface.
	 *
	 * This method is intended for language bindings. If writing in C,
	 * g_initable_new() should typically be used instead.
	 *
	 * The object must be initialized before any real use after initial
	 * construction, either with this function or g_async_initable_init_async().
	 *
	 * Implementations may also support cancellation. If @cancellable is not %NULL,
	 * then initialization can be cancelled by triggering the cancellable object
	 * from another thread. If the operation was cancelled, the error
	 * %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED will be returned. If @cancellable is not %NULL and
	 * the object doesn't support cancellable initialization the error
	 * %G_IO_ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned.
	 *
	 * If the object is not initialized, or initialization returns with an
	 * error, then all operations on the object except g_object_ref() and
	 * g_object_unref() are considered to be invalid, and have undefined
	 * behaviour. See the [introduction][ginitable] for more details.
	 *
	 * Callers should not assume that a class which implements #GInitable can be
	 * initialized multiple times, unless the class explicitly documents itself as
	 * supporting this. Generally, a classâ€™ implementation of init() can assume
	 * (and assert) that it will only be called once. Previously, this documentation
	 * recommended all #GInitable implementations should be idempotent; that
	 * recommendation was relaxed in GLib 2.54.
	 *
	 * If a class explicitly supports being initialized multiple times, it is
	 * recommended that the method is idempotent: multiple calls with the same
	 * arguments should return the same results. Only the first call initializes
	 * the object; further calls return the result of the first call.
	 *
	 * One reason why a class might need to support idempotent initialization is if
	 * it is designed to be used via the singleton pattern, with a
	 * #GObjectClass.constructor that sometimes returns an existing instance.
	 * In this pattern, a caller would expect to be able to call g_initable_init()
	 * on the result of g_object_new(), regardless of whether it is in fact a new
	 * instance.
	 *
	 * Params:
	 *     cancellable = optional #GCancellable object, %NULL to ignore.
	 *
	 * Returns: %TRUE if successful. If an error has occurred, this function will
	 *     return %FALSE and set @error appropriately if present.
	 *
	 * Since: 2.22
	 *
	 * Throws: GException on failure.
