/**
 * GIOStream represents an object that has both read and write streams.
 * Generally the two streams act as separate input and output streams,
 * but they share some common resources and state. For instance, for
 * seekable streams, both streams may use the same position.
 * 
 * Examples of #GIOStream objects are #GSocketConnection, which represents
 * a two-way network connection; and #GFileIOStream, which represents a
 * file handle opened in read-write mode.
 * 
 * To do the actual reading and writing you need to get the substreams
 * with g_io_stream_get_input_stream() and g_io_stream_get_output_stream().
 * 
 * The #GIOStream object owns the input and the output streams, not the other
 * way around, so keeping the substreams alive will not keep the #GIOStream
 * object alive. If the #GIOStream object is freed it will be closed, thus
 * closing the substreams, so even if the substreams stay alive they will
 * always return %G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED for all operations.
 * 
 * To close a stream use g_io_stream_close() which will close the common
 * stream object and also the individual substreams. You can also close
 * the substreams themselves. In most cases this only marks the
 * substream as closed, so further I/O on it fails but common state in the
 * #GIOStream may still be open. However, some streams may support
 * "half-closed" states where one direction of the stream is actually shut down.
 * 
 * Operations on #GIOStreams cannot be started while another operation on the
 * #GIOStream or its substreams is in progress. Specifically, an application can
 * read from the #GInputStream and write to the #GOutputStream simultaneously
 * (either in separate threads, or as asynchronous operations in the same
 * thread), but an application cannot start any #GIOStream operation while there
 * is a #GIOStream, #GInputStream or #GOutputStream operation in progress, and
 * an application canâ€™t start any #GInputStream or #GOutputStream operation
 * while there is a #GIOStream operation in progress.
 * 
 * This is a product of individual stream operations being associated with a
 * given #GMainContext (the thread-default context at the time the operation was
 * started), rather than entire streams being associated with a single
 * #GMainContext.
 * 
 * GIO may run operations on #GIOStreams from other (worker) threads, and this
 * may be exposed to application code in the behaviour of wrapper streams, such
 * as #GBufferedInputStream or #GTlsConnection. With such wrapper APIs,
 * application code may only run operations on the base (wrapped) stream when
 * the wrapper stream is idle. Note that the semantics of such operations may
 * not be well-defined due to the state the wrapper stream leaves the base
 * stream in (though they are guaranteed not to crash).
 *
 * Since: 2.22

	 * return an error.
	 *
	 * Closing a stream will automatically flush any outstanding buffers
	 * in the stream.
	 *
	 * Streams will be automatically closed when the last reference

	 * resources are released as early as possible.

	 * Some streams might keep the backing store of the stream (e.g. a file

	 * the individual stream for details.

	 * On failure the first error that happened will be reported, but the

	 * to close will still return %G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED for all operations.

	 *
	 * If @cancellable is not NULL, then the operation can be cancelled by
	 * triggering the cancellable object from another thread. If the operation

	 * Cancelling a close will still leave the stream closed, but some streams
	 * can use a faster close that doesn't block to e.g. check errors.
