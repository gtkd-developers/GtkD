/**
 * #GDebugController is an interface to expose control of debugging features and
 * debug output.
 * 
 * It is implemented on Linux using #GDebugControllerDBus, which exposes a D-Bus
 * interface to allow authenticated peers to control debug features in this
 * process.
 * 
 * Whether debug output is enabled is exposed as
 * #GDebugController:debug-enabled. This controls g_log_set_debug_enabled() by
 * default. Application code may connect to the #GObject::notify signal for it
 * to control other parts of its debug infrastructure as necessary.
 * 
 * If your application or service is using the default GLib log writer function,
 * creating one of the built-in implementations of #GDebugController should be
 * all thatâ€™s needed to dynamically enable or disable debug output.
 *
 * Since: 2.72
