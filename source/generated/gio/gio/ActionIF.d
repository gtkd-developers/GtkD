/**
 * #GAction represents a single named action.
 * 
 * The main interface to an action is that it can be activated with
 * g_action_activate().  This results in the 'activate' signal being
 * emitted.  An activation has a #GVariant parameter (which may be
 * %NULL).  The correct type for the parameter is determined by a static
 * parameter type (which is given at construction time).
 * 
 * An action may optionally have a state, in which case the state may be
 * set with g_action_change_state().  This call takes a #GVariant.  The
 * correct type for the state is determined by a static state type
 * (which is given at construction time).
 * 
 * The state may have a hint associated with it, specifying its valid
 * range.
 * 
 * #GAction is merely the interface to the concept of an action, as
 * described above.  Various implementations of actions exist, including
 * #GSimpleAction.
 * 
 * In all cases, the implementing class is responsible for storing the
 * name of the action, the parameter type, the enabled state, the
 * optional state type and the state and emitting the appropriate
 * signals when these change.  The implementor is responsible for filtering
 * calls to g_action_activate() and g_action_change_state() for type
 * safety and for the state being enabled.
 * 
 * Probably the only useful thing to do with a #GAction is to put it
 * inside of a #GSimpleActionGroup.

	/**
	 * Parses a detailed action name into its separate name and target
	 * components.
	 *
	 * Detailed action names can have three formats.
	 *
	 * The first format is used to represent an action name with no target
	 * value and consists of just an action name containing no whitespace
	 * nor the characters ':', '(' or ')'.  For example: "app.action".
	 *
	 * The second format is used to represent an action with a target value
	 * that is a non-empty string consisting only of alphanumerics, plus '-'
	 * and '.'.  In that case, the action name and target value are
	 * separated by a double colon ("::").  For example:
	 * "app.action::target".
	 *
	 * The third format is used to represent an action with any type of
	 * target value, including strings.  The target value follows the action
	 * name, surrounded in parens.  For example: "app.action(42)".  The
	 * target value is parsed using g_variant_parse().  If a tuple-typed
	 * value is desired, it must be specified in the same way, resulting in
	 * two sets of parens, for example: "app.action((1,2,3))".  A string
	 * target can be specified this way as well: "app.action('target')".
	 * For strings, this third format must be used if * target value is
	 * empty or contains characters other than alphanumerics, '-' and '.'.
	 *
	 * Params:
	 *     detailedName = a detailed action name
	 *     actionName = the action name
	 *     targetValue = the target value, or %NULL for no target
	 *
	 * Returns: %TRUE if successful, else %FALSE with @error set

	 * Since: 2.38

	 * Throws: GException on failure.
