/**
 * `GtkFixed` places its child widgets at fixed positions and with fixed sizes.
 * 
 * `GtkFixed` performs no automatic layout management.
 * 
 * For most applications, you should not use this container! It keeps
 * you from having to learn about the other GTK containers, but it
 * results in broken applications.  With `GtkFixed`, the following
 * things will result in truncated text, overlapping widgets, and
 * other display bugs:
 * 
 * - Themes, which may change widget sizes.
 * 
 * - Fonts other than the one you used to write the app will of course
 * change the size of widgets containing text; keep in mind that
 * users may use a larger font because of difficulty reading the
 * default, or they may be using a different OS that provides different fonts.
 * 
 * - Translation of text into other languages changes its size. Also,
 * display of non-English text will use a different font in many
 * cases.
 * 
 * In addition, `GtkFixed` does not pay attention to text direction and
 * thus may produce unwanted results if your app is run under right-to-left
 * languages such as Hebrew or Arabic. That is: normally GTK will order
 * containers appropriately for the text direction, e.g. to put labels to
 * the right of the thing they label when using an RTL language, but it canâ€™t
 * do that with `GtkFixed`. So if you need to reorder widgets depending on
 * the text direction, you would need to manually detect it and adjust child
 * positions accordingly.
 * 
 * Finally, fixed positioning makes it kind of annoying to add/remove
 * UI elements, since you have to reposition all the other elements. This
 * is a long-term maintenance problem for your application.
 * 
 * If you know none of these things are an issue for your application,
 * and prefer the simplicity of `GtkFixed`, by all means use the
 * widget. But you should be aware of the tradeoffs.
