/**
 * `GtkEditable` is an interface for text editing widgets.
 * 
 * Typical examples of editable widgets are [class@Gtk.Entry] and
 * [class@Gtk.SpinButton]. It contains functions for generically manipulating
 * an editable widget, a large number of action signals used for key bindings,
 * and several signals that an application can connect to modify the behavior
 * of a widget.
 * 
 * As an example of the latter usage, by connecting the following handler to
 * [signal@Gtk.Editable::insert-text], an application can convert all entry
 * into a widget into uppercase.
 * 
 * ## Forcing entry to uppercase.
 * 
 * ```c
 * #include <ctype.h>
 * 
 * void
 * insert_text_handler (GtkEditable *editable,
 * const char  *text,
 * int          length,
 * int         *position,
 * gpointer     data)
 * {
 * char *result = g_utf8_strup (text, length);
 * 
 * g_signal_handlers_block_by_func (editable,
 * (gpointer) insert_text_handler, data);
 * gtk_editable_insert_text (editable, result, length, position);
 * g_signal_handlers_unblock_by_func (editable,
 * (gpointer) insert_text_handler, data);
 * 
 * g_signal_stop_emission_by_name (editable, "insert_text");
 * 
 * g_free (result);
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * ## Implementing GtkEditable
 * 
 * The most likely scenario for implementing `GtkEditable` on your own widget
 * is that you will embed a `GtkText` inside a complex widget, and want to
 * delegate the editable functionality to that text widget. `GtkEditable`
 * provides some utility functions to make this easy.
 * 
 * In your class_init function, call [func@Gtk.Editable.install_properties],
 * passing the first available property ID:
 * 
 * ```c
 * static void
 * my_class_init (MyClass *class)
 * {
 * ...
 * g_object_class_install_properties (object_class, NUM_PROPERTIES, props);
 * gtk_editable_install_properties (object_clas, NUM_PROPERTIES);
 * ...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * In your interface_init function for the `GtkEditable` interface, provide
 * an implementation for the get_delegate vfunc that returns your text widget:
 * 
 * ```c
 * GtkEditable *
 * get_editable_delegate (GtkEditable *editable)
 * {
 * return GTK_EDITABLE (MY_WIDGET (editable)->text_widget);
 * }
 * 
 * static void
 * my_editable_init (GtkEditableInterface *iface)
 * {
 * iface->get_delegate = get_editable_delegate;
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * You don't need to provide any other vfuncs. The default implementations
 * work by forwarding to the delegate that the GtkEditableInterface.get_delegate()
 * vfunc returns.
 * 
 * In your instance_init function, create your text widget, and then call
 * [method@Gtk.Editable.init_delegate]:
 * 
 * ```c
 * static void
 * my_widget_init (MyWidget *self)
 * {
 * ...
 * self->text_widget = gtk_text_new ();
 * gtk_editable_init_delegate (GTK_EDITABLE (self));
 * ...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * In your dispose function, call [method@Gtk.Editable.finish_delegate] before
 * destroying your text widget:
 * 
 * ```c
 * static void
 * my_widget_dispose (GObject *object)
 * {
 * ...
 * gtk_editable_finish_delegate (GTK_EDITABLE (self));
 * g_clear_pointer (&self->text_widget, gtk_widget_unparent);
 * ...
 * }
 * ```
 * 
 * Finally, use [func@Gtk.Editable.delegate_set_property] in your `set_property`
 * function (and similar for `get_property`), to set the editable properties:
 * 
 * ```c
 * ...
 * if (gtk_editable_delegate_set_property (object, prop_id, value, pspec))
 * return;
 * 
 * switch (prop_id)
 * ...
 * ```
 * 
 * It is important to note that if you create a `GtkEditable` that uses
 * a delegate, the low level [signal@Gtk.Editable::insert-text] and
 * [signal@Gtk.Editable::delete-text] signals will be propagated from the
 * "wrapper" editable to the delegate, but they will not be propagated from
 * the delegate to the "wrapper" editable, as they would cause an infinite
 * recursion. If you wish to connect to the [signal@Gtk.Editable::insert-text]
 * and [signal@Gtk.Editable::delete-text] signals, you will need to connect
 * to them on the delegate obtained via [method@Gtk.Editable.get_delegate].
