 * `GtkViewport` implements scrollability for widgets that lack their

 * Use `GtkViewport` to scroll child widgets such as `GtkGrid`,

 * The `GtkViewport` will start scrolling content only if allocated
 * less than the child widgetâ€™s minimum size in a given orientation.
 * 
 * # CSS nodes
 * 
 * `GtkViewport` has a single CSS node with name `viewport`.
 * 
 * # Accessibility

 * `GtkViewport` uses the %GTK_ACCESSIBLE_ROLE_GROUP role.
